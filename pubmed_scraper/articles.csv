2,Reframing Mental Health Ethics,"Mental health ethics has been classically focused on ethical concepts and problems in clinical mental health spaces. Psychiatric and psychotherapeutic ethics are main threads of analysis in this subfield of bioethics. However, ethical issues emerge around mental health and illness both within and beyond clinical settings. In particular, ethical quandaries arise in employment, education, family caregiving, and incarceration of people with mental health conditions outside of the clinical setting. Likewise, ethics are an important consideration within alternative care systems where mentally ill people seek support beyond biomedicine, psychotherapy, and case management. In this article, we argue that our understanding of ""mental health ethics"" should expand to be more inclusive of value questions and conflicts that arise in all areas of the lives of people with mental health conditions, rather than focusing more narrowly on how clinical practitioners and researchers should best respond to ethical quandaries in the delivery of mental healthcare. Community mental health is an ideal space in which to think about such ethical issues, as scholars and practitioners in the field strive to meet not only medical needs but the broader social needs of people with mental health conditions. We begin by providing an overview of psychiatric and psychotherapeutic ethics, and then describe broader applications of ethics in the lives of people experiencing mental illness. We encourage community mental health practitioners and researchers to reconceptualize disciplinary boundaries to consider the vast scope of ethical issues related to mental health in and out of the clinic.","['1 Department of Bioethics, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, 10900 Euclid Avenue, Sears Tower TA200, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA. julia.knopes@case.edu.', '2 Cleveland Clinic Center for Bioethics, Cleveland, USA.']","Julia Knopes, Laura Guidry-Grimes, ",Community mental health journal,2024 Feb,Bioethics; Lived experience; Mental health ethics; Psychiatric ethics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37787887,springer
3,Heatwave and mental health,"Physical health has been associated with ambient temperature and heatwave. With the frequent occurrence of heatwave, the adaptive effects and mechanisms on mental health remain uncertain. On the basis of the China Health and Nutrition Survey, we estimated the relationship between heatwaves and self-assessed mental health scores in the Chinese population aged 50 and above. This study has identified that with each additional heatwave event, mental health scores decreased by an average of 0.027 points, which is equivalent to 0.3% of the average level. Heat is more likely to affect groups with low education, no medical insurance, and living in rural areas. In mechanistic exploration, we found that stress emotion is a fully mediating effect. Heat led to reduced health activities and more frequent drinking, which may lead to lower psychological well-being. Moreover, good dietary preference is a regulator that can help mitigate the adverse effects of heat on mental health. This study corroborates the impact of heat on spiritual welfare, and demonstrates the mechanisms and channels of impact, which can help reduce global economic losses due to mental health problems.","['1 School of Economics, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.

4,Refugee mental health: Culturally relevant considerations,"In recent years, multiple global crises have contributed to increasing human displacement. Currently, there are approximately 84 million displaced people around the world. Many suffer from mental health problems. However, the mental health service delivery system is not fully prepared to meet the complex needs of refugees. Refugees experience multiple barriers, both individual and systemic, to accessing and engaging in mental health treatment. The following article provides an overview of some of the challenges faced by refugees worldwide and avenues forward. The authors also examine contextual factors that impact refugee resettlement and discuss barriers to culturally responsive, trauma-informed, and ethical care. Finally, the authors review advocacy efforts and discuss future directions to improve refugee mental health care delivery.","['1 Boston University School of Medicine/ Boston Medical Center Boston Center for Refugee Health and Human Rights (BCRHHR), Immigrant and Refugee Health Center (IRHC), USA.

7,Editorial introduction: animal models relevant to mental health disorders,"Mental health disorders affect a substantial proportion of the worldwide population, and currently available treatments do not work for all affected individuals. Understanding the psychological and biological mechanisms that underlie mental health disorders will facilitate treatment development, and the use of translational animal models is potentially transformative for this. Structured around the US National Institute of Mental Health's 'Research Domain Criteria' (RDoC) approach, this special issue showcases reviews that consider how animal models can best be used to understand and treat the processes that go awry in mental health disorders.","['1 Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, U.K.']","Amy L Milton, ",Emerging topics in life sciences,2022 Dec 9,mental health; research domain criteria; translational science.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36484519,PMC

17,Opening up mental health research,"Open science provides a compelling framework for accelerating global collaborations and enabling discoveries to understand and treat mental health disorders. Herein, we discuss the advantages and obstacles to adopting open science in mental health research, considering the particularities of sensitive and diverse data types, the potential of co-designing projects with research participants and the opportunity of amplifying open science by integration with mental health care. We present a practical example of how this landscape may be navigated to adopt open science across an entire research centre, in 5 steps, namely leadership committing to open science; finding models, resources and allies; identifying needs; defining open science principles; and putting principles into practice. We derive lessons learned that can be built upon by researchers and research organizations joining the open science movement in mental health.","['1 From the Douglas Research Centre, Montréal, Que.

34,Mental health in refugee children,"Almost half of the world's forcibly displaced population are children, most commonly originating from Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan. Health disparities are well documented, especially for mental health, but not consistent across groups, time or context. Despite high exposure to trauma and stress, refugee children also show remarkable resilience. An ecological model of refugee health including both risk and resilience factors is therefore recommended. The model also includes the dynamic inter-relationship of past traumatic experiences, ongoing daily stressors and the disruptions of basic systems affecting both the individual and families as a whole, offering a framework to better understand the health disparities and appropriate interventions for refugee children.","['1 Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences, Faculty of Health and Social Sciences, Hamarvegen 112, 2418 Elverum, Norway.

39,Mental Health and Mental Wellbeing Impact Assessment Frameworks-A Systematic Review,"Mental health is largely shaped by the daily environments in which people live their lives, with positive components of mental health emphasising the importance of feeling good and functioning effectively. Promoting mental health relies on broad-based actions over multiple sectors, which can be difficult to measure. Different types of Impact Assessment (IA) frameworks allow for a structured approach to evaluating policy actions on different levels. A systematic review was performed exploring existing IA frameworks relating to mental health and mental wellbeing and how they have been used. A total of 145 records were identified from the databases, from which 9 articles were included in the review, with a further 6 studies included via reference list and citation chaining. Five different mental-health-related IA frameworks were found to be implemented in a variety of settings, mostly in relation to evaluating community actions. A Narrative Synthesis summarised key themes from the 15 included articles. Findings highlight the need for participatory approaches in IA, which have the dual purpose of informing the IA evaluation and advocating for the need to include mental health in policy development. However, it is important to ensure that IA frameworks are user-friendly, designed to be used by laypeople in a variety of sectors and that IA frameworks are operational in terms of time and monetary resources.","['1 Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, 00271 Helsinki, Finland.', '2 Mieli-Mental Health Finland, 00240 Helsinki, Finland.']","Johanna Cresswell-Smith, Tapani Kauppinen, Taina Laaksoharju, Tuulia Rotko, Pia Solin, Jaana Suvisaari, Kristian Wahlbeck, Nina Tamminen, ",International journal of environmental research and public health,2022 Oct 27,impact assessment; mental health; mental health promotion; mental wellbeing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36360865,PMC

44,Plasticity in mental health: A network theory,"Plasticity is the ability to modify brain and behavior, ultimately promoting an amplification of the impact of the context on the individual's mental health. Thus, plasticity is not beneficial per se but its value depends on contextual factors, such as the quality of the living environment. High plasticity is beneficial in a favorable environment, but can be detrimental in adverse conditions, while the opposite applies to low plasticity. Resilience and vulnerability are not univocally associated to high or low plasticity. Consequently, individuals should undergo different preventive and therapeutic strategies according to their plasticity levels and living conditions. Here, an operationalization of plasticity relying on network theory is proposed: the strength of the connection among the network elements defining the individual, such as its symptoms, is a measure of plasticity. This theoretical framework represents a promising tool to investigate research questions related to changes in neural structure and activity and in behavior, and to improve therapeutic strategies for psychiatric disorders, such as major depression.","['1 Center for Behavioral Sciences and Mental Health, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Rome, Italy.

To do this, we leverage the age-specific exposure to an educational reform as an instrument for years of education and find that the treated cohorts gained more education. This increase in education had an effect on mental health more than 2 decades later. An extra year of education led to a lower likelihood of reporting any symptoms related to depression (11.3%) and anxiety (9.8%). More educated people also suffered less severe symptoms - depression (6.1%) and anxiety (5.6%). These protective effects are higher among women and rural residents. The effects of education on mental well-being that we document are potentially mediated through better physical health, improved health behavior and knowledge, and an increase in women's empowerment.","['1 University of Sussex, Brighton, UK.', '2 Bentley University, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA.']","Fjolla Kondirolli, Naveen Sunder, ",Health economics,2022 Oct,Africa; Zimbabwe; education; mental health.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35797349,PMC

47,Mental Health Impacts of Climate Change on Women: a Scoping Review,"Climate change is the largest threat to human health of the twenty-first century. Women are disproportionately affected by climate change. While the physical health impacts of climate change are an active area of research, works related to the mental health impacts are less developed. Furthermore, the mental health impacts of climate change on women are a particular area of interest due to women's disproportionately negative experiences with climate change and climate change-related events. Therefore, the purpose of this scoping review is to understand what is known from the existing literature regarding the mental health impacts of climate change on women. The methods for this review follow the Arksey and O'Malley framework for a scoping review. By searching databases for publications that discuss women, mental health, and climate change, and screening for relevant work, 20 studies that met inclusion criteria were included in the review. Themes derived from the reviewed studies include negative mental health outcomes, gender-based violence, burdens of care and responsibility, attachment to land and traditions, and the importance of intersectionality. From these findings, there is a clear need for climate policies on adaptation and mitigation to reflect women's unique needs to ensure their health and safety.","['1 School of Health and Human Performance, Faculty of Health, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.
