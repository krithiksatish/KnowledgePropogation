0,Environmental crisis and mental health,"Global warming threatens the survival of humanity and is the greatest challenge of our generation. While the consequences for physical health are well documented, the impact on mental health, while considerable, was too little studied. This unprecedented crisis is putting a strain on our health care systems and is mostly affecting vulnerable and precarious populations. There is an urgent need to rethink and improve our way of life, our work habits and the resilience of our health care system.","['1 Petit Bourgogne, ISoSL, Liège, Belgique.', '2 Service de Psychiatrie et Unité de Psychoneuro-endocrinologie, CHU Liège, ULiège, Belgique.']","S Bierlier, G Scantamburlo, ",Revue medicale de Liege,2022 Dec,Mental health; Natural disaster; Resilience; Solastalgia; Global warming.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36484752,NO TEXT (not hosted on top 3 sites)

3,Editorial Perspective: Prescribing measures: unintended negative consequences of mandating standardized mental health measurement,"In July 2020, two of the largest funders of mental health research worldwide - the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the Wellcome Trust - announced plans to standardize mental health measurement. Specifically, obtaining funding for research related to depression and anxiety will be conditional on using four specific measures. While we agree that there are obvious benefits to standardizing mental health measurement, some of which are discussed in the announcement by NIMH and Wellcome, here we focus on potential unintended negative consequences of this initiative: Lacking transferability across settings: scales were developed for specific settings (e.g. community, clinic) and purposes (e.g. intervention studies), and their properties might not be easily transferable between settings. Narrowing the scope of inquiry: individuals experience mental health difficulties in wide-ranging ways, and the narrow scope of the proposed scales risks limiting important insights for research and treatments. Lowering the threshold for robust evidence: empirical findings limited to a specific imperfect measure are less robust than if such evidence is (re)produced across multiple scales. Creating a two-tiered mental health science: arbitrarily conferring gold standard status on some imperfect measures over others will create an artificial two-tiered system leading to an impoverishment of mental health research. Recommendations for mitigating these negative consequences include the following: mandating a wider set of measures that have been validated for specific populations and research purposes, funding research assessing the measurement properties of scales across settings and purposes, stressing the limitations of mandated measures to avoid en masse application and replacement of measures across studies and health systems and creating speed bumps to ensure that any widespread adoption of mandated measures does not result in impoverishment of mental health science.","['1 Centre for Longitudinal Studies and MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, University College London, London, UK.', '2 Clinical Psychology Unit, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands.']","Praveetha Patalay, Eiko I Fried, ","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines",2021 Aug,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32986859,NO TEXT (not hosted on top 3 sites)

8,Classification of Digital Mental Health Interventions: A Rapid Review and Framework Proposal,"The modern context of mental health interventions asks for an inclusion of digital solutions to the face-to-face approach, providing better access and reduced inequity for patients. The current classification of digital mental health interventions can be system specific (mobile apps) or general (virtual therapy), which causes inadequacy in applications. The goal of this study was to develop a framework to improve digital mental health interventions classification. We performed a rapid review of the literature on existing digital mental health interventions frameworks. We identified four existing frameworks, extracted their purpose, categories and items, completed a thematic analysis and formulated a four domains framework proposal. This framework allows to classify digital mental health interventions on their system, function, time and facilitation, which should facilitate our understanding of the effect of singular characteristics on patient outcomes.","['1 Faculty of Nursing Sciences, Université Laval, Québec, Canada.', '2 VITAM Centre de recherche en santé durable.', '3 Department of Family and Emergency Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Université Laval, Québec, Canada.']","Marie-Pierre Gagnon, Maxime Sasseville, Annie Leblanc, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2022 May 25,Digital health; classification; digital interventions; mental health.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35612165,NO TEXT (not hosted on top 3 sites)

10,Work Discussion for community mental health,"This paper aims to emphasize the pertinence of psychoanalytic work in the context of communitary mental health. The theoretical orientations for this are based on the concept of Social Defence Systems, as introduced by Jaques and developed by Menzies, and the intervention method used is Work Discussion, an original and applicable approach designed and consolidated at the Tavistock Clinic. With this contributions, we are able to consider the ways in which Institution´s malfunctioning relates to ways in which it´s work implies a defensive activity with which its participants, workers and patients, can be unconsciously colluded. After describing this method and the mentality behind it, this work describes in detail its application in the context of a Communitary Mental Health Centre in Santiago, Chile. Some clinical examples are included, together with some thoughts about the value that this intervention has for the community.","['1 Chilean Psychoanalytical Association - International Psychoanalytical Association, Santiago, Chile.']","Ricardo Readi, ",The International journal of psycho-analysis,2023 Jun,Bion; institutional dynamics; menzies; social defense system; work discussion.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37410063,tandfonline

12,Mental health and smoking cessation-a population survey in England,"Background:
        
      
      To reduce inequalities between individuals with and without mental health problems, a better understanding is required of triggers and success of quit attempts among the third of smokers with mental health problems. The aim was to assess whether there are differences by mental health status in (i) triggers for quit attempts, (ii) use of evidence-based support (iii) and quit success. Methods:
        
      
      Monthly cross-sectional household surveys of representative samples of the adult population in England. In 2016/2017, 40,831 adults were surveyed; 1956 who had attempted to stop smoking cigarettes in the past year were included. Logistic regressions assessed associations between mental health (ever diagnosis, past-year treatment, past-month distress), triggers, support used and quit success, adjusting for sociodemographic and smoking characteristics. Results:
        
      
      Concern about future health, current health problems and expense of smoking were the most common triggers overall. For respondents with an ever diagnosis, past-year treatment or serious past-month distress, quit attempts were more frequently triggered by current health problems. Non-evidence-based support and e-cigarettes were used most often, and this did not differ by mental health status. Respondents with an ever diagnosis and moderate or serious distress were less likely to have used non-prescription nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Respondents with past-year treatment or serious distress were more likely to have used prescription medication/behavioural support. Quit success did not differ by mental health status. Compared with non-evidence-based support, non-prescription NRT conferred no benefit. There was some evidence that prescription medication/behavioural support was beneficial (depending on outcome and adjustment, ORs ranged from 1.46, 95% CI 0.92-2.31, to 1.69, 1.01-2.86). E-cigarettes were associated with higher success rates after adjustment for different indicators of mental health (ORs ranged from 2.21, 1.64-2.98, to 2.25, 1.59-3.18). Conclusions:
        
      
      Smokers with mental health problems were more likely to have attempted to quit because of health problems and were more likely to have used gold standard support (medication and behavioural support) than other smokers. E-cigarettes were strongly associated with increased success and were used similarly by those with and without mental health problems, indicating that improved uptake of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation among smokers with mental health problems could help address inequalities.","[""1 Addictions, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, 4 Windsor Walk, London, SE5 8BB, UK. leonie.brose@kcl.ac.uk."", '2 , . leonie.brose@kcl.ac.uk.', '3 .', '4 Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London, 1-19 Torrington Place, London, WC1E 7HB, UK.', '5 Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London, 1-19 Torrington Place, London, WC1E 7HB, UK.', ""6 Addictions, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, 4 Windsor Walk, London, SE5 8BB, UK.""]","Leonie S Brose, Jamie Brown, Ann McNeill, ",BMC medicine,2020 Jun 25,Electronic cigarettes; Mental health; Smoking cessation; Tobacco smoking.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32580770,PMC
13,Inequalities in mental health: predictive processing and social life,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      The paper applies recent conceptualisations of predictive processing to the understanding of inequalities in mental health. Recent findings:
        
      
      Social neuroscience has developed important ideas about the way the brain models the external world, and how the interface between cognitive and cultural processes interacts. These resonate with earlier concepts from cybernetics and sociology. These approaches could be applied to understanding some of the dynamics leading to the patterning of mental health problems in populations. Summary:
        
      
      The implications for practice are the way such thinking might help illuminate how we think and act, and how these are anchored in the social world.","['1 Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge, East Forvie Building, Forvie Site, Cambridge, UK.', '2 Birmingham City University, Birmingham, UK.', ""3 Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Herchel Smith Building, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK, Wellcome Trust MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, UK.""]","Michael P Kelly, Carol Brayne, Ann Louise Kinmonth, Natasha Kriznik, John Ford, Paul C Fletcher, ",Current opinion in psychiatry,2021 Mar 1,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33394729,journals.lww

16,Delivery of Compassionate Mental Health Care in a Digital Technology-Driven Age: Scoping Review,"Background:
        
      
      Compassion is a vital component to the achievement of positive health outcomes, particularly in mental health care. The rise of digital technologies may influence the delivery of compassionate care, and thus this relationship between compassion and digital health care needs to be better understood. Objective:
        
      
      This scoping review aimed to identify existing digital technologies being used by patients and health professionals in the delivery of mental health care, understand how digital technologies are being used in the delivery of compassionate mental health care, and determine the facilitators of and barriers to digital technology use among patients and health professionals in the delivery of compassionate mental health care. Methods:
        
      
      We conducted this scoping review through a search of Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), MEDLINE In-Process and EPub Ahead of Print, PsycINFO, and Web of Science for articles published from 1990 to 2019. Results:
        
      
      Of the 4472 articles screened, 37 articles were included for data extraction. Telemedicine was the most widely used technology by mental health professionals. Digital technologies were described as facilitating compassionate care and were classified using a conceptual model to identify each digital intersection with compassionate care. Facilitators of and barriers to providing compassionate care through digital technology were identified, including increased safety for providers, health care professional perceptions and abilities, and the use of picture-in-picture feedback to evaluate social cues. Conclusions:
        
      
      Implementing digital technology into mental health care can improve the current delivery of compassionate care and create novel ways to provide compassion. However, as this is a new area of study, mental health professionals and organizations alike should be mindful that compassionate human-centered care is maintained in the delivery of digital health care. Future research could develop tools to facilitate and evaluate the enactment of compassion within digital health care.","['1 Faculty of Science, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada.', '2 Information Management Group, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada.', '3 Office of Education, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada.', '4 Education Technology and Innovation, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', '5 Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', '6 Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', '7 Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada.']","Jessica Kemp, Timothy Zhang, Fiona Inglis, David Wiljer, Sanjeev Sockalingam, Allison Crawford, Brian Lo, Rebecca Charow, Mikayla Munnery, Shuranjeet Singh Takhar, Gillian Strudwick, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2020 Mar 6,compassion; health information technology; medical informatics; mental health; nursing informatics; psychiatry.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32141833,PMC
17,Organizational and Policy Barriers to the Use of Digital Mental Health by Mental Health Professionals,"Background: Digital mental health (DMH) provides effective methods of overcoming issues of time constraints, accessibility, and availability of mental health care. They can provide a valuable means to deliver mental health care in the present pandemic. However, adoption of these methods has been slow. Mental health professional (MHP) concerns at the organizational and policy level that influence this slow adoption need to be examined. Materials and Methods: A narrative review was conducted to identify the barriers. Searches using the databases Scopus, Embase, and PubMed were conducted to identify research focused on barriers reported by MHPs to use DMH. Results: The search resulted in 356 unique citations, and 21 papers met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Forward and backward sampling resulted in identifying an additional 19 relevant papers. Discussion: Unmet needs for information, training, and infrastructure, challenges to the workflow and excessive workloads, and ambiguous policies serve as barriers to DMH use. This article recommends strategies for researchers, organizations, DMH designers, and governmental institutions to ensure efficient utilization of DMH. Conclusions: Concerted efforts at individual, organizational, and governmental levels are essential to ensure efficient utilization of DMH.","['1 School of Applied Psychology, Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia.', '2 Menzies Health Institute, Mount Gravatt, Australia.']","Aarthi Ganapathy, Bonnie A Clough, Leanne M Casey, ",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,2021 Dec,challenges; gatekeepers; internet interventions; providers; review; tele-mental health.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33646057,NO TEXT (not hosted on top 3 sites)

26,Mental Health and Recreation Opportunities,"The environment has direct and indirect effects on mental health. Previous studies acknowledge that the poor design of communities and social environments leads to increased psychological distress, but methodological issues make it difficult to draw clear conclusions. Recent public health, leisure and recreation studies have tried to determine the relationship between recreation opportunities and mental health. However, previous studies have heavily focused on individual contexts rather than national or regional levels; this is a major limitation. It is difficult to reflect the characteristics of community environments effectively with such limited studies, because social environments and infrastructure should be analyzed using a spatial perspective that goes beyond an individual's behavioral patterns. Other limitations include lack of socioeconomic context and appropriate data to represent the characteristics of a local community and its environment. To date, very few studies have tested the spatial relationships between mental health and recreation opportunities on a national level, while controlling for a variety of competing explanations (e.g., the social determinants of mental health). To address these gaps, this study used multi-level spatial data combined with various sources to: (1) identify variables that contribute to spatial disparities of mental health; (2) examine how selected variables influence spatial mental health disparities using a generalized linear model (GLM); (3) specify the spatial variation of the relationships between recreation opportunities and mental health in the continental U.S. using geographically weighted regression (GWR). The findings suggest that multiple factors associated with poor mental health days, particularly walkable access to local parks, showed the strongest explanatory power in both the GLM and GWR models. In addition, negative relationships were found with educational attainment, racial/ethnic dynamics, and lower levels of urbanization, while positive relationships were found with poverty rate and unemployment in the GLM. Finally, the GWR model detected differences in the strength and direction of associations for 3109 counties. These results may address the gaps in previous studies that focused on individual-level scales and did not include a spatial context.","['1 Department of Recreation, Parks and Leisure Services Administration, Central Michigan University, Mount Pleasant, MI 48859, USA.']","Kyung Hee Lee, ",International journal of environmental research and public health,2020 Dec 14,geographically weighted regression; mental health days; opportunity theory; recreation opportunities; walkability.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33327395,mdpi
27,"Stress, mental and physical health and the costs of health care in German high school students","Stress is a mind-body phenomenon, which affects both mental and physical health and is highly relevant to the health care system. Yet, knowledge on the costs of stress and related health problems in adolescence is missing. The present study addresses this gap by investigating direct health care costs in relation to stress, mental health problems and physical health in high school students. The sample comprised 284 pupils from four schools in Heidelberg (mean age 16.75 ± 0.64 years, 59.64% female). Self-reported health care utilization and medication intake within 1 month were translated into costs. We established correlative associations of the dichotomized overall costs (no vs. any) with stress, mental health problems and physical health within generalized structural equation models. In particular, mental health problems and physical health were examined as mediators of the association between stress and costs. An increase of stress by 1 SD corresponded increased chances for costs by OR 1.39 (Odds Ratio; 95% CI 0.13-0.53, p = 0.001). When mediators were analysed separately, both mental and physical health (problems) fully mediated the association. Yet, when examined together, only mental health problems acted as a mediator. Our results indicate the health economic relevance of stress-related mental health problems in high school students. The finding is meant to set the stage for further cost-of-illness studies of stress and related health problems, as well as economic evaluations. Longitudinal research is needed to allow conclusions on directionality.","['1 Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Centre for Psychosocial Medicine, Heidelberg University Hospital, Blumenstraße 8, 69115, Heidelberg, Germany.', '2 Faculty of Behavioural and Cultural Studies, Institute of Psychology, University of Heidelberg, Hauptstraße 47-51, 69117, Heidelberg, Germany.', '3 Medical Faculty Mannheim, Central Institute of Mental Health, Heidelberg University, J5, 68159, Mannheim, Germany.', '4 Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Centre for Psychosocial Medicine, Heidelberg University Hospital, Blumenstraße 8, 69115, Heidelberg, Germany.

29,Exploring Mental Health and Illness in the UK Sports Coaching Workforce,"There is growing international concern about the mental health of those who work in sport, including coaches. However, we currently know little about the prevalence of mental illness and the experience of mental health among coaches, and their perceptions and use of workplace mental health support services. Little is also known about coaches' disclosure of mental illness to, and seeking help from, work colleagues. We explore these issues using data from 202 coaches who responded to the first United Kingdom survey of mental health in the sport and physical activity workforce. In total, 55% of coaches reported having ever experienced a mental illness, and 44% currently did, with coaches in grassroots/community settings being most likely to experience mental illness. Depression and anxiety were the most commonly reported conditions and many coaches preferred to access mental health support outside of the organisation for whom they worked or volunteered, with decisions to seek help from others in the workplace being shaped by complex organisational and personal considerations. The findings suggest there is an important public health challenge which needs to be met among coaches, so that we can better address a question of fundamental importance: 'who is looking after the people looking after the people'?","['1 Department of Sport and Physical Activity, Edge Hill University, St Helens Road, Ormskirk L39 4QP, UK.', '2 Thrive Approach, The Quadrangle, 1 Seale Hayne, Howton Road, Newton Abbot TQ12 6NQ, UK.', '3 DOCIAsport, Sussex Innovation Centre, University of Sussex, Science Park Square, Brighton BN1 9SB, UK.']","Andy Smith, David Haycock, Jon Jones, Kenny Greenough, Rachel Wilcock, Ian Braid, ",International journal of environmental research and public health,2020 Dec 13,community; duty of care; mental illness; stigma; work.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33322222,mdpi

      Four trajectories of mental health symptoms were identified (low, high-decreasing, moderate-increasing and high-increasing). Most children with mental health symptoms had few MBS mental health attendances, and only a minority received care meeting study criteria for minimally adequate treatment. Children in the high-increasing and moderate-increasing trajectories were more likely to access care, yet there was no evidence of improvement in symptoms. Conclusions:
        
      
      It is important that children and adolescents with mental health problems receive treatment that meets minimal practice guidelines. Further research is needed to identify the quality of care currently provided to children with mental health difficulties and how clinicians can be best funded and supported to provide care meeting minimal practice guidelines.

33,Decriminalizing LGBTQ+: Reproducing and resisting mental health inequities,"Secure settings are not queer because lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, Two Spirit, and asexual (LGBTQ+) people populate them, and neither are LGBTQ+ people inherently criminal because they are found in those spaces. Queer people bear disproportionate health, mental health, and social inequities that have had, historically and currently, the effect to criminalize them. This review discusses effective language and ideologies when working with LGBTQ+ people in secure settings. Major health, mental health, and social inequities are reviewed, along with the applied framework of minority stress. Then, the process of criminalization is diagrammed across the phases of predetainment, being in the system, and through re-entering the community. Finally, multilevel strategies are offered to decriminalize LGBTQ+ people ideologically and in practice.","['1 MSW Program, Division of Social Work, California State University, Sacramento, Sacramento, California, USA.']","Tyler M Argüello, ",CNS spectrums,2020 Oct,LGBTQ+; affirmative practice; cultural competence.; heteronormativity; minority stress; queer.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32349833,NO TEXT (not hosted on top 3 sites)
34,Perinatal insurance coverage and behavioural health-related maternal mortality,"Increases in postpartum maternal deaths, including a substantial number associated with behavioural health conditions, are a public health crisis and have contributed to overall increases in maternal mortality. A leading hypothesis to explain this pattern suggests lack of availability or continuity of resources for behavioural health treatment after delivery, often secondary to lapses in insurance coverage. Extending postpartum Medicaid coverage through the first year postpartum could mitigate excess morbidity and mortality among postpartum individuals, particularly those with behavioural health conditions.","['1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '2 Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '3 Department of Psychiatry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '4 VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '5 Division of Health Policy and Management, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.']","Lindsay K Admon, Kara Zivin, Katy B Kozhimannil, ","International review of psychiatry (Abingdon, England)",2021 Sep,Maternal mortality; behavioural health; health insurance; postpartum; pregnancy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34098849,PMC

In order to reduce stress and its consequences, humanitarian organizations are implementing various measures to keep their staff healthy. Humanitarian workers, on the other hand, must take care of themselves and apply self-protection mechanisms. Most humanitarian workers are doing well.

39,Universal Mental Health Interventions for Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review of Health Economic Evaluations,"Background:
        
      
      Effective mental health interventions may reduce the impact that mental health problems have on young people's well-being. Nevertheless, little is known about the cost effectiveness of such interventions for children and adolescents. Objectives:
        
      
      The objectives of this systematic review were to summarize and assess recent health economic evaluations of universal mental health interventions for children and adolescents aged 6-18 years. Methods:
        
      
      Four electronic databases were searched for relevant health economic studies, using a pre-developed search algorithm. Full health economic evaluations evaluating the cost effectiveness of universal mental health interventions were included, as well as evaluations of anti-bullying and suicide prevention interventions that used a universal approach. Studies on the prevention of substance abuse and those published before 2013 fell outside the scope of this review. Study results were summarised in evidence tables, and each study was subject to a systematic quality appraisal. Results:
        
      
      Nine studies were included in the review; in six, the economic evaluation was conducted alongside a clinical trial. All studies except one were carried out in the European Union, and all but one evaluated school-based interventions. All evaluated interventions led to positive incremental costs compared to their comparators and most were associated with small increases in quality-adjusted life-years. Almost half of the studies evaluated the cost effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy-based interventions aimed at the prevention of depression or anxiety, with mixed results. Cost-effectiveness estimates for a parenting programme, a school-based social and emotional well-being programme and anti-bullying interventions were promising, though the latter were only evaluated for the Swedish context. Drivers of cost effectiveness were implementation costs; intervention effectiveness, delivery mode and duration; baseline prevalence; and the perspective of the evaluation. The overall study quality was reasonable, though most studies only assessed short-term costs and effects. Conclusion:
        
      
      Few studies were found, which limits the possibility of drawing strong conclusions about cost effectiveness. There is some evidence based on decision-analytic modelling that anti-bullying interventions represent value for money. Generally, there is a lack of studies that take into account long-term costs and effects. Systematic review registration number:

40,Mental health triage tools: A narrative review,"Mental Health Triage (MHT) tools may be defined as any clinician administered scale that specifies psychiatric signs or symptoms, proposes a corresponding service response, and determines priority categories based on the level of perceived acuity. Multiple MHT tools are used across different jurisdictions and care settings. This article summarizes the literature on MHT tools, describes the available tools and the supportive evidence, evaluates the impact and clinical applications, and compares their strengths and weaknesses. This review utilized a systematic review process to identify articles examining MHT tools. Several benefits of using MHT tools are described; however, in general, the supportive evidence for their use is lacking. A modified Australasian Triage Scale has the strongest evidence base for use in emergency settings; however, further data are needed to establish improved outcomes. There is limited evidence for the use of MHT tools in ambulatory or primary care settings. No evidence was found supporting any one tool as effective in guiding service responses across the entire clinical spectrum. Future research could focus on developing and evaluating MHT tools that service all levels of illness presentation. Additionally, more robust studies are required to support the use of MHT tools in emergency settings. Finally, there is an impetus for the development and evaluation of MHT tools in ambulatory, community, and primary care settings.","['1 Barwon Health, Mental Health, Drugs and Alcohol Service, Geelong, Victoria, Australia.', '2 Monash Health, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.', '3 School of Medicine, Deakin University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']","Tayler Watson, Rachel Tindall, Amelia Patrick, Steven Moylan, ",International journal of mental health nursing,2023 Apr,mental health; mental health services; psychiatric nursing; psychiatry; triage.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36176247,wiley

      Although many studies have analyzed mental health problems in college students in China, the associations of mental health with individual and family circumstances, academic performance, and social support were rarely discussed. Objectives:
        
      
      The study aimed to determine the mental health status and its associated factors among college students in China. Methods:
        
      
      An online survey was conducted on 300 students selected through a cluster sampling strategy in a university in Hubei, China, tapping into sociodemographic characteristics of the participants, their mental health status measured by the modified Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), and social support measured by the Social Support Rating Scale. Multivariate linear regression models were established to identify predictors of the SCL-90 scores. Results:
        
      
      Mental health disorders were found in 8% of the respondents, with obsessive compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity and depression as the top three reported problems. Compared with the national population norms of university students in 2014, our study participants had higher scores in SCL-90. There were statistically significant difference in the Global Severity index (GSI) and all nine subscales scores (p<0.05). Poorer self-rated health, higher study pressure, and lower social support were significant predictors of higher SCL-90 scores (p<0.05) after adjustment for variations in other variables.

47,Addressing Common Mental Health Disorders Among Incarcerated People Living with HIV: Insights from Implementation Science for Service Integration and Delivery,"Purpose:
        
      
      Despite evidence of disproportionate burden of HIV and mental health disorders among incarcerated people, scarce services exist to address common mental health disorders, including major depressive and anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and substance use disorders, among incarcerated people living with HIV (PLHIV) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This paper aims to summarize current knowledge on mental health interventions of relevance to incarcerated PLHIV and apply implementation science theory to highlight strategies and approaches to deliver mental health services for PLHIV in correctional settings in SSA. Recent findings:
        
      
      Scarce evidence-based mental health interventions have been rigorously evaluated among incarcerated PLHIV in SSA. Emerging evidence from low- and middle-income countries and correctional settings outside SSA point to a role for cognitive behavioral therapy-based talking and group interventions implemented using task-shifting strategies involving lay health workers and peer educators. Several mental health interventions and implementation strategies hold promise for addressing common mental health disorders among incarcerated PLHIV in SSA. However, to deliver these approaches, there must first be pragmatic efforts to build corrections health system capacity, address human rights abuses that exacerbate HIV and mental health, and re-conceptualize mental health services as integral to quality HIV service delivery and universal access to primary healthcare for all incarcerated people.","['1 Implementation Science Unit, Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ), Lusaka, Zambia.', '2 James Cook University, Townsville, Australia.', '3 The Aurum Institute, Johannesburg, South Africa.', '4 Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', '5 University of the Witwatersrand Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa.', '6 Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', '7 Implementation Science Unit, Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ), Lusaka, Zambia. michael.herce@cidrz.org.', '8 Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA. michael.herce@cidrz.org.']","Helene J Smith, Stephanie M Topp, Christopher J Hoffmann, Thulani Ndlovu, Salome Charalambous, Laura Murray, Jeremy Kane, Izukanji Sikazwe, Monde Muyoyeta, Michael E Herce, ",Current HIV/AIDS reports,2020 Oct,Depression; HIV; Implementation science; Mental health; Peer; Prisons; Sub-Saharan Africa.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32779099,PMC

50,Mental health first aid: strengthening its impact for aid recipients,"Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) is a potentially valuable first response in mental healthcare. MHFA is formulated as an extension of Psychological First Aid, the latter being a more focal response to crises and disasters. MHFA is a broader strategy which aims to improve the general public's immediate response to mental ill health and mental health crisis. While its effect on those trained in MHFA has been promising, recent meta-analyses have failed to detect any significant benefit to individuals who receive support from an MHFA trainee. Such outcomes highlight the need to revisit the content and implementation of MHFA to optimise and realise the full potential of the concept. Possible solutions are discussed, including developing new MHFA content using methodologies that foster innovation and creativity, in addition to improving the quality and effectiveness of MHFA training.","['1 Orygen, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', '2 Centre for Youth Mental Health, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', '3 Orygen, Parkville, Victoria, Australia pat.mcgorry@orygen.org.au.']","Cristina Mei, Patrick D McGorry, ",Evidence-based mental health,2020 Nov,psychiatry.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32727814,PMC
51,Mental Health Disorders and Summer Temperature-Related Mortality: A Case Crossover Study,"Identifying the most vulnerable subjects is crucial for the effectiveness of health interventions aimed at limiting the adverse consequences of high temperatures. We conducted a case crossover study aimed at assessing whether suffering from mental health disorders modifies the effect of high temperatures on mortality. We included all deaths occurred in the area of Bologna Local Health Trust during the summers 2004-2017. Subjects with mental disorders were identified by using the local Mental Health Registry. A conditional logistic model was applied, and a z-test was used to study the effect modification. Several models were estimated stratifying by subjects' characteristics. For every 1 °C above 24 °C, mortality among people without mental disorders increased by 1.9% (95% CI 1.0-2.6, p < 0.0001), while among mental health service users, mortality increased by 5.5% (95% CI 2.4-8.6, p < 0.0001) (z-test equal to p = 0.0259). The effect modification varied according to gender, residency and cause of death. The highest probability of dying due to an increase in temperature was registered in patients with depression and cognitive decline. In order to reduce the effects of high temperatures on mortality, health intervention strategies should include mental health patients among the most vulnerable subjects taking account of their demographic and clinical characteristics.","['1 Department of Pubblic Health, Azienda USL di Bologna, 40121 Bologna, Italy.', '2 Department of Mental Health, Azienda USL di Bologna, 40123 Bologna, Italy.', '3 Department of Statistical Sciences, University of Bologna, 40126 Bologna, Italy.', '4 Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences (DIMEC), University of Bologna, 40123 Bologna, Italy.']","Elisa Stivanello, Federico Chierzi, Paolo Marzaroli, Sara Zanella, Rossella Miglio, Patrizia Biavati, Vincenza Perlangeli, Domenico Berardi, Angelo Fioritti, Paolo Pandolfi, ",International journal of environmental research and public health,2020 Dec 7,heat waves; high temperature; mental health; vulnerability.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33297344,mdpi
52,Forgiveness and Health Outcomes in Cancer Survivorship: A Scoping Review,"Background:
        
      
      Religious and spiritual beliefs including forgiveness are an important aspect of cancer survivorship; however, the relationship between forgiveness and health is not well understood. Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to conduct a scoping review that examines and maps the current research regarding relationships between forgiveness and health outcomes in individuals with cancer. Methods:
        
      
      We searched 5 electronic databases using key search terms related to forgiveness and cancer. Using a scoping review framework, we synthesized the existing literature regarding forgiveness and health among individuals with cancer and examined forgiveness as a process for coping with cancer. Results:
        
      
      We located 277 articles for review; 24 met inclusion criteria. Forgiveness in interpersonal relationships emerged more often as forgiveness coping than other types of forgiveness. Most studies reported a positive association between forgiveness and mental health. Fewer studies were available regarding relationships between forgiveness and physical health, and findings were mixed. Conclusions:
        
      
      Forgiveness in interpersonal relationships is a spiritual concern for individuals with cancer. Addressing forgiveness needs may promote mental health in cancer survivors. More empirical evidence is needed to understand the role of forgiveness in physical health in individuals with cancer. Implications for practice:
        
      
      Acknowledging forgiveness beliefs is a psychosocial-spiritual intervention that nurses can provide to support mental health in individuals with cancer. The potential role of forgiveness in physical health for individuals with cancer requires further study.","['1 Author Affiliations: School of Social Work, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (Dr Kim); School of Nursing, University of Missouri (Dr Hulett), Columbia; and College of Nursing, University of South Carolina (Dr Heiney), Columbia.']","Jeongsuk Kim, Jennifer Hulett, Sue P Heiney, ",Cancer nursing,2021 Jul-Aug,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32332263,journals.lww
53,Probiotics-targeting new milestones from gut health to mental health,"Conventional probiotic food research was primarily focused on their benefits for gut health. Recently with the confirmation that the gut microbiota has a bidirectional connection with the brain, it is being proposed that modification of the microbiota can possibly extirpate neurological diseases. Development of probiotic foods and formulations for neural health benefits has garnered interest, with a renewed focus. In this context, this review discusses the evidences collected on the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of probiotics, especially during the time span of 2015-till now. Although, more clinical trials are necessary to elucidate the exact mechanism of probiotic mode of action but several of the established probiotic strains have been investigated and it appears that few of them have demonstrated their potential as 'psychobiotics'. The formulation of new psychobiotic-based therapeutics is in the spotlight. It is expected that in near future, biological effect of probiotics on neurological conditions will open up an entirely new avenue for personalized medication and healthcare in mental health, and they can be tailored according to the gut-microbiota of specific individuals.","['1 School of Biotechnology, Campus 11, Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, Deemed to be University, Patia, Bhubaneswar, Odisha.

57,Dyadic coping and mental health in couples: A systematic review,"Globally, one out of three people suffer from a mental health issue during their lifetime. In romantic relationships, impaired mental health does not only affect the individual but also their partner and therefore needs to be coped with dyadically. In this systematic review, we summarize research examining dyadic coping (DC) in the context of mental health and individual and relational outcomes. We searched for peer-reviewed articles published between January 1990 and April 2023 on PsycInfo, Medline, and PSYNDEX on DC and mental health within romantic relationships. A total of 60 qualitative, quantitative, and intervention studies met the inclusion criteria, reporting on 16,394 individuals and 4,945 dyads. To synthesize the studies, we used a narrative synthesis approach. Overall, stress expression and positive DC yielded beneficial individual and relational outcomes, whereas, for negative DC, the opposite was true. Results differed between mental health clusters and context played an important role (e.g., symptom severity, life phase). Due to the great diversity of studies and variables, further research should focus on understudied mental health clusters (e.g., anxiety disorders).

58,Mental Health and Self-Esteem of Active Athletes,"Introduction:
        
      
      Systematic and continuous physical exercise of certain intensity and volume is irreplaceable in the stages of growth and development and in preventing impairments of the biological, functional and health state of the human organism.Many studies show that physical exercise contributes to development and reinforcement of mental health and increases self-esteem. Examine mental health and self-esteem of active athletes. Subjects and methods:
        
      
      The subjects of the study are active athletes from Herzegovina and students of the Faculty of Health Studies in Mostar. Mental health and self-esteem were measured by a sociodemographic questionnaire, The Symptom Checklist-90 and the Satisfaction With Life Scale. Results:
        
      
      There is a statistically significant difference in the frequency of exercise, active athletes have the highest percentage (100%) and state that they exercise often (almost every day) while university students have a significantly lower percentage (20%).Students scored significantly higher on the subscales for somatization, obsessive - compulsive symptoms, interpersonal vulnerability, depression, anxiety, aggression, phobia, and paranoia than active athletes. Active athletes have statistically higher scores for almost all the claims of the subjective assessment of life satisfaction. Conclusion:
        
      
      Active athletes showed significantly less psychological symptoms and better mental health, greater life satisfaction and higher self-esteem than students of the Faculty of Health Studies in Mostar.","['1 Faculty of Health Studies, University of Mostar, 88000 Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina.']","Boris Lukanović, Mario Babić, Smiljana Katić, Ivana Čerkez Zovko, Marko Martinac, Marko Pavlović, Dragan Babić, ",Psychiatria Danubina,2020 Sep,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32970642,NO TEXT (not hosted on top 3 sites)

60,Connected Mental Health: Systematic Mapping Study,"Background:
        
      
      Although mental health issues constitute an increasing global burden affecting a large number of people, the mental health care industry is still facing several care delivery barriers such as stigma, education, and cost. Connected mental health (CMH), which refers to the use of information and communication technologies in mental health care, can assist in overcoming these barriers. Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this systematic mapping study is to provide an overview and a structured understanding of CMH literature available in the Scopus database. Methods:
        
      
      A total of 289 selected publications were analyzed based on 8 classification criteria: publication year, publication source, research type, contribution type, empirical type, mental health issues, targeted cohort groups, and countries where the empirically evaluated studies were conducted. Results:
        
      
      The results showed that there was an increasing interest in CMH publications; journals were the main publication channels of the selected papers; exploratory research was the dominant research type; advantages and challenges of the use of technology for mental health care were the most investigated subjects; most of the selected studies had not been evaluated empirically; depression and anxiety were the most addressed mental disorders; young people were the most targeted cohort groups in the selected publications; and Australia, followed by the United States, was the country where most empirically evaluated studies were conducted. Conclusions:
        
      
      CMH is a promising research field to present novel approaches to assist in the management, treatment, and diagnosis of mental health issues that can help overcome existing mental health care delivery barriers. Future research should be shifted toward providing evidence-based studies to examine the effectiveness of CMH solutions and identify related issues.","['1 Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates.', '2 National School For Computer Science, Mohammed V University in Rabat, Rabat, Morocco.', '3 Salumedia Labs, Seville, Spain.', '4 Adhera Health Inc, Palo Alto, CA, United States.', '5 TICLab, International University of Rabat, Rabat, Morocco.']","Nidal Drissi, Sofia Ouhbi, Mohammed Abdou Janati Idrissi, Luis Fernandez-Luque, Mounir Ghogho, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2020 Aug 28,connected health; eHealth; health informatics; information systems; information technology; interdisciplinary research; mHealth; mental health; mobile health; mobile phone; review; telehealth.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32857055,PMC
61,Employment is a critical mental health intervention,"employment is critically important in mental health care. Unemployment worsens mental health and gaining employment can improve mental health, even for people with the most serious mental illnesses. In this editorial, we argue for a new treatment paradigm in mental health that emphasises employment, because supported employment is an evidence-based intervention that can help the majority of people with mental health disability to succeed in integrated, competitive employment. Unlike most mental health treatments, employment engenders self-reliance and leads to other valued outcomes, including self-confidence, the respect of others, personal income and community integration. It is not only an effective short-term treatment but also one of the only interventions that lessen dependence on the mental health system over time.","['1 Westat, Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA.', '2 Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA.']","Robert E Drake, Michael A Wallach, ",Epidemiology and psychiatric sciences,2020 Nov 5,Community mental health; evidence-based psychiatry; health service research; psychiatric services.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33148366,PMC
62,Accounting for mental health research funding: developing a quantitative baseline of global investments,"High-quality data on funding for mental health research are essential to mapping funding levels, identifying gaps in the funding landscape, and tracking the impact of research funding. To date, quantitative analyses of research funding in mental health have been restricted in scope. In this Health Policy paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of grant funding for mental health research as a starting point for discussion among stakeholders globally. We drew on a major international research database and used existing definitions and automated classification tools for mental health research. Our analysis shows a flat and stable trend over the years 2015-19 and highly unequal geographical distribution of funding, and reveals patterns of funding across different conditions and across the research spectrum. Improvements in data availability and quality, in the definitions delineating mental health research from other areas, and in automated classification tools are needed to ensure funders and policy makers can fully rely on the data and generate bespoke analyses as needed. We argue that collaborative reporting of funding for mental health research globally could help to inform and evaluate efforts to increase investments, to improve strategic dialogue, and to achieve the best possible allocation of finite resources.","['1 Technopolis UK, Brighton, UK.', '2 Graham Boeckh Foundation, Montreal, Canada; International Alliance of Mental Health Research Funders, Montreal, Canada.', '3 International Alliance of Mental Health Research Funders, Montreal, Canada.', '4 Graham Boeckh Foundation, Montreal, Canada; International Alliance of Mental Health Research Funders, Montreal, Canada.

63,Mobile Mental Health Apps in China: Systematic App Store Search,"Background:
        
      
      Smartphones have become ubiquitous in China, offering a promising way to deliver mental health interventions; however, little is known about the current use and characteristics of smartphone apps for mental health. Objective:
        
      
      The purpose of this study was to gain insight into mobile mental health apps available in China as of December 2018. Methods:
        
      
      A systematic search was conducted to identify and evaluate the most downloaded apps from iOS and Android platforms. Apps were categorized according to their main purpose and downloaded to evaluate their content. Each app's affiliation, cost, target users, information security, and evidence-based nature were evaluated. Results:
        
      
      Of the 172 unique apps that were identified, there were 37 apps (21.5%) for psychological counseling, 50 apps (29.1%) for assessment, 12 apps (7.0%) to relieve stress, 24 apps (14.0%) for psychoeducation, and 49 (28.4%) multipurpose apps (ie, a combination of counseling and assessment). Most apps were developed for adults in the general population (166/172, 96.5%), rather than for psychiatric patients. App-based counseling was mostly provided by psychologists, and of the assessed apps, only 40% (70/172) used evidence-based scales to assess mental health problems such as anxiety or depressed mood. Guided meditation was used as the main technique in stress-relieving apps. Conclusions:
        
      
      Many apps contained useful and evidence-based elements, such as good quality information, validated measurements, and useful meditation methods; however, for mobile apps to contribute significantly to mental health care in China, considerable challenges remain, including the need for more patient-focused apps that can actually take on the role of a health care provider. In addition, efficacy studies are needed.","['1 Tianjin Anding Hospital, Tianjin, China.', '2 Department of Psychiatry, Interdisciplinary Center Psychopathology and Emotion regulation, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.']","Huifang Yin, Klaas J Wardenaar, Yuhao Wang, Nan Wang, Wenjin Chen, Yan Zhang, Guangming Xu, Robert A Schoevers, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2020 Jul 27,China; app; mental health problem; mental illness; mobile mental health; smartphone.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32716301,PMC

66,Changes in society and young people's mental health1,"It is well recognized that many psychiatric disorders are strongly influenced by cultural and social factors. Foucault's account of the modern development links together 'madness', psychiatry and the asylum. We pick up the story at the point Foucault left it, the mid-twentieth century, to examine cultural and social processes that are reshaping concepts, discourse and practices - the 'social imaginary' - around mental health, with particular reference to the apparent rise in mental health problems among the young. We conclude that this apparent rise may reflect cultural and social changes in representations of mental health. In addition, over recent decades there have been increasingly evident fractures in social solidarity, interacting with and exacerbating specific socio-political-economic-environmental stressors on younger generations, including increasing intergenerational wealth inequalities and accelerating environmental concerns.","[""1 Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.""]","Derek Bolton, Dinesh Bhugra, ","International review of psychiatry (Abingdon, England)",2021 Feb-Mar,Anomie; Durkheim; Foucault; Mental health; intergenerational wealth inequalities; post-truth; social imaginary; young people.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32347134,tandfonline
67,Perceptions and Opinions of Patients About Mental Health Chatbots: Scoping Review,"Background:
        
      
      Chatbots have been used in the last decade to improve access to mental health care services. Perceptions and opinions of patients influence the adoption of chatbots for health care. Many studies have been conducted to assess the perceptions and opinions of patients about mental health chatbots. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no review of the evidence surrounding perceptions and opinions of patients about mental health chatbots. Objective:
        
      
      This study aims to conduct a scoping review of the perceptions and opinions of patients about chatbots for mental health. Methods:
        
      
      The scoping review was carried out in line with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) extension for scoping reviews guidelines. Studies were identified by searching 8 electronic databases (eg, MEDLINE and Embase) in addition to conducting backward and forward reference list checking of the included studies and relevant reviews. In total, 2 reviewers independently selected studies and extracted data from the included studies. Data were synthesized using thematic analysis. Results:
        
      
      Of 1072 citations retrieved, 37 unique studies were included in the review. The thematic analysis generated 10 themes from the findings of the studies: usefulness, ease of use, responsiveness, understandability, acceptability, attractiveness, trustworthiness, enjoyability, content, and comparisons. Conclusions:
        
      
      The results demonstrated overall positive perceptions and opinions of patients about chatbots for mental health. Important issues to be addressed in the future are the linguistic capabilities of the chatbots: they have to be able to deal adequately with unexpected user input, provide high-quality responses, and have to show high variability in responses. To be useful for clinical practice, we have to find ways to harmonize chatbot content with individual treatment recommendations, that is, a personalization of chatbot conversations is required.","['1 Division of Information and Computing Technology, College of Science and Engineering, Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Qatar Foundation, Doha, Qatar.', '2 Institute of Digital Healthcare, University of Warwick, Warwick, United Kingdom.', '3 Institute for Medical Informatics, Bern University of Applied Science, Bern, Switzerland.', '4 Leeds Institute of Health Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom.']","Alaa A Abd-Alrazaq, Mohannad Alajlani, Nashva Ali, Kerstin Denecke, Bridgette M Bewick, Mowafa Househ, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2021 Jan 13,chatbots; conversational agents; mental disorders; mental health; mobile phone; opinions; perceptions.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33439133,PMC
68,The impact of green spaces on mental health in urban settings: a scoping review,"Background:
        
      
      Our planet is currently experiencing the largest wave of urban growth in history, with 55% of the world's population (4.2 billion people) currently living in urban areas, a figure set to rise to 70% by 2050. Primary care is the first point of treatment for most mental health disorders. Since the urban environment and health are intrinsically linked, it is useful to examine the effectiveness of Nature-Based Solutions in addressing mental health. Aims:
        
      
      The aim of this scoping review was to examine ""How urban green spaces can improve mental health and wellbeing among patients attending general practice and primary care?"" Methods:
        
      
      The scoping review framework comprised a five-stage process developed by Arksey and O'Malley. Results:
        
      
      Twenty-five studies were included in the review, mostly cross-sectional studies. A wide range of mental health outcomes were identified. Out of the 25 included studies, 23 showed positive associations between mental health and green space characteristics. Conclusion:
        
      
      Our findings suggest that while green spaces are associated with positive mental health outcomes, most studies were cross-sectional in nature and provided limited evidence for association. Furthermore, the population samples used in most of the studies were taken from national survey data and were not specifically primary care patients. Further studies that assess primary care patients specifically are warranted.","['1 School of Medicine, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.', '2 School of Geography, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.']","A Callaghan, G McCombe, A Harrold, C McMeel, G Mills, N Moore-Cherry, W Cullen, ","Journal of mental health (Abingdon, England)",2021 Apr,Urban environment; green spaces; mental health.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32310728,tandfonline

      We review recent developments within digital phenotyping for mental health, a field dedicated to using digital data for diagnosing, predicting, and monitoring mental health problems. We especially focus on recent critiques and challenges to digital phenotyping from within the social sciences. Recent findings:
        
      
      Three significant strands of criticism against digital phenotyping for mental health have been developed within the social sciences. This literature problematizes the idea that digital data can be objective, that it can be unbiased, and argues that it has multiple ethical and practical challenges. Digital phenotyping for mental health is a rapidly growing and developing field, but with considerable challenges that are not easily solvable. This includes when, and if, data from digital phenotyping is actionable in practice; the involvement of user and patient perspectives in digital phenotyping research; the possibility of biased data; and challenges to the idea that digital phenotyping can be more objective than other forms of psychiatric assessment.","['1 Department of Communication & Psychology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark. rbirk@ikp.aau.dk.', ""2 Department of Global Health & Social Medicine, King's College London, London, UK.""]","Rasmus H Birk, Gabrielle Samuel, ",Current psychiatry reports,2022 Oct,Digital phenotyping; Ethics; Explainability; Objectivity; Sociology.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36001220,springer

71,Principles and practices of risk assessment in mental health jail diversion programs,"Eligibility criteria for participation in mental health jail diversion programs often specify that, to be diverted, a candidate must not pose a level of threat to public safety that cannot be managed in the community. Risk assessment tools were developed to increase consistency and accuracy in estimates of threat to public safety. Consequently, risk assessment tools are being used in many jurisdictions to inform decisions regarding an individual's appropriateness and eligibility for mental health jail diversion and the strategies that may be successful in mitigating risk in this context. However, their use is not without controversy. Questions have been raised regarding the validity and equity of their estimates, as well as the impact of their use on criminal justice outcomes. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the science and practice of risk assessment to inform decisions and case planning in the context of mental health jail diversion programs. Our specific aims include: (1) to describe the process and components of risk assessment, including differentiating between different approaches to risk assessment, and (2) to consider the use of risk assessment tools in mental health jail diversion programs. We anchor this review in relevant theory and extant research, noting current controversies or debates and areas for future research. Overall, there is strong theoretical justification and empirical evidence from other criminal justice contexts; however, the body of research on the use of risk assessment tools in mental health jail diversion programs, although promising, is relatively nascent.","['1 Department of Psychology, and Center for Family and Community Engagement, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA.', '2 Department of Criminology, Law and Society, George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia, USA.']","Sarah L Desmarais, Evan M Lowder, ",CNS spectrums,2020 Oct,Risk assessment; Risk–Need–Responsivity model.; case planning; mental health jail diversion; risk mitigation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31760961,NO TEXT (not hosted on top 3 sites)
72,Mental health: The burden of social stigma,"The burden of mental health has two facets, social and psychological. Social stigma causes individuals who suspect to be suffering from a mental condition to conceal it, importantly by seeking care from a nonspecialist provider willing to diagnose it as physical disease. In this way, social stigma adds to both the direct and indirect cost of mental health. A microeconomic model depicting an individual who searches for an accommodating provider leads to the prediction that individuals undertake more search in response to a higher degree of social stigma. However, this holds only in the absence of errors in decision-making, typically as long as mental impairment is not too serious. While government and employers have an incentive to reduce the burden of social stigma, their efforts therefore need to focus on persons with a degree of mental impairment that still allows them to avoid errors in pursuing their own interest.","['1 Department of Economics, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.']","Peter Zweifel, ",The International journal of health planning and management,2021 May,concealment; mental health; nondisclosure; search; social stigma.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33591577,wiley

It can be said that ""there is no health without mental health"". We also know that mental health is influenced to a large extent by the environmental, economic, etc. context, but also from personal characteristics (genetic patrimony, what has been transmitted to us from parents, one's own experience, etc.). From the complex interplay of these factors, each individual perceives their own state of mental health. Having made these premises, we try, and this is the goal of this work, to verify whether in the post-modern society in which we live, the presuppositions and conditions exist that give the individual the possibility to adapt to the environment that surrounds him and to live. in harmony with himself, reaching a good level of mental health, or on the contrary if in the globalized civilization in which we live, those points of reference that contributed to a good social adaptation and consequently to a good psychic compensation have failed.","['1 Mental Health Department of San Vincenzo Clinic, 88024 Girifalco, Catanzaro, Italy, straniti@virgilio.it.']","Giuseppe Stranieri, ",Psychiatria Danubina,2022 Sep,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36170730,NO TEXT (not hosted on top 3 sites)

This paper first described the negative impact of COVID-19 and 4IR on our mental health. Then, following a brief critique of the medical model, this paper proposes that the future of psychotherapy needs to be based on the more inclusive and integrative framework of existential positive psychology (PP 2.0), which emphasizes flourishing through suffering. Finally, the paper emphasizes Viktor Frankl's cure and Wong's integrative meaning therapy. It concludes that integrative meaning therapy represents the future of psychotherapy, because it is situated in the area of interactions of at least three traditions: Clinical psychology, existential psychology, and positive psychology. This integrative model is holistic, recognising humans as bio-psycho-social-spiritual beings and considers several theoretical perspectives in both diagnosis and treatment.","['1 Department of Psychology, Trent University, Peterborough, Canada.']","Paul T P Wong, ","International review of psychiatry (Abingdon, England)",2020 Nov-Dec,Existential positive psychology (PP2.0); Viktor Frankl; existential psychology; logotherapy; meaning therapy; positive psychology; psychiatry.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33016788,tandfonline

78,Cost-effectiveness evidence of mental health prevention and promotion interventions: A systematic review of economic evaluations,"Background:
        
      
      The prevention of mental disorders and promotion of mental health and well-being are growing fields. Whether mental health promotion and prevention interventions provide value for money in children, adolescents, adults, and older adults is unclear. The aim of the current study is to update 2 existing reviews of cost-effectiveness studies in this field in order to determine whether such interventions are cost-effective. Methods and findings:
        
      
      Electronic databases (including MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and EconLit through EBSCO and Embase) were searched for published cost-effectiveness studies of prevention of mental disorders and promotion of mental health and well-being from 2008 to 2020. The quality of studies was assessed using the Quality of Health Economic Studies Instrument (QHES). The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (# CRD42019127778). The primary outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) or return on investment (ROI) ratio across all studies. A total of 65 studies met the inclusion criteria of a full economic evaluation, of which, 23 targeted children and adolescents, 35 targeted adults, while the remaining targeted older adults. A large number of studies focused on prevention of depression and/or anxiety disorders, followed by promotion of mental health and well-being and other mental disorders. Although there was high heterogeneity in terms of the design among included economic evaluations, most studies consistently found that interventions for mental health prevention and promotion were cost-effective or cost saving. The review found that targeted prevention was likely to be cost-effective compared to universal prevention. Screening plus psychological interventions (e.g., cognitive behavioural therapy [CBT]) at school were the most cost-effective interventions for prevention of mental disorders in children and adolescents, while parenting interventions and workplace interventions had good evidence in mental health promotion. There is inconclusive evidence for preventive interventions for mental disorders or mental health promotion in older adults. While studies were of general high quality, there was limited evidence available from low- and middle-income countries. The review was limited to studies where mental health was the primary outcome and may have missed general health promoting strategies that could also prevent mental disorder or promote mental health. Some ROI studies might not be included given that these studies are commonly published in grey literature rather than in the academic literature. Conclusions:
        
      
      Our review found a significant growth of economic evaluations in prevention of mental disorders or promotion of mental health and well-being over the last 10 years. Although several interventions for mental health prevention and promotion provide good value for money, the varied quality as well as methodologies used in economic evaluations limit the generalisability of conclusions about cost-effectiveness.

79,Migration and Acculturation: What We Can Expect in the Future,"The use of violence and aggression on civilians during the war has become one of the most prominent military events of the 20th and 21st centuries, resulting in an increasing number of refugees and displaced persons in the midst of regional and tribal conflicts. We are witnessing a daily increase in the number of migrants when people are fleeing from their homes because of human rights violations, persecution, poverty, and conflict. When found in ""host"" countries, they often encounter bad conditions, with uncertainty and instability. Many come to Europe in search of economic and personal opportunities for progress, where they face different types of process of acculturation. 'Place loss', acute and chronic trauma, family disorders, and family reunification issues became more and more important issues. Refugees, asylum seekers and irregular migrants have a higher risk for certain mental health disorders, including posttraumatic stress, depression and psychosis. In addition to being exposed to various risk factors for mental disorders, migrants often face barriers to access to adequate health care to address these issues. Some of the biggest challenges for migrant populations within ""host"" countries include: lack of knowledge of health care rights and health systems; poor knowledge of the language; different belief systems and cultural expectations of health care; and the general lack of trust in experts and in government. The rates of depressive and anxiety disorders usually increase over time, and poor mental health is associated with poor socioeconomic conditions - particularly with social isolation and unemployment. Acculturative stress often implies a high discrepancy in the acculturation between parents and their children. This dislocation of families in new conditions has been caused by the different degrees of acceptance of ""new culture"" by children and parents, which causes serious difficulties, especially in bilingual terms.","['1 Department of Psychiatry, University Clinical Center Tuzla, Ul.

80,Systems all the way down: embracing complexity in mental health research,"In this editorial for the collection on complexity in mental health research, we introduce and summarize the inaugural contributions to this collection: a series of theoretical, methodological, and empirical papers that aim to chart a path forward for investigating mental health in all its complexity. A central theme emerges from these contributions: if we are to make genuine progress in explaining, predicting, and treating mental illness, we must study the systems from which psychopathology emerges. As the articles in this collection make clear, the systems that give rise to psychopathology encompass a host of components across biological, psychological, and social levels of analysis, intertwined in a web of complex interactions. The task of advancing our understanding of these systems will be a challenging one. Yet, this challenge presents a unique opportunity. From physics to ecology, there is a rapidly evolving body of interdisciplinary research dedicated to investigating complex systems. This work provides clear guidance for psychiatric research, opportunities for collaboration, and a set of tools and concepts from which we can draw in our efforts to understand mental health, helping us move toward our ultimate aim of improving the prevention and treatment of psychopathology.","['1 Department of Clinical Psychology, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands. eikofried@gmail.com.', '2 Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School & Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.']","Eiko I Fried, Donald J Robinaugh, ",BMC medicine,2020 Jul 14,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32660482,PMC
81,The clinical implications of climate change for mental health,"Climate change affects mental health through multiple pathways, including direct and indirect impacts, physical health and awareness of the climate crisis. Climate change increases the magnitude and frequency of extreme events with little or no time for recovery. This Review aims to provide an overview of the current evidence to inform the mental health field's response to climate change. While further innovation is needed, promising approaches for health professionals are identified at the levels of interventions for individuals, community and system-wide responses, and advocacy and education. Health worker training is important, so we offer guidance on mental health assessment and clinical risks from climate change. We also outline strategies to enhance individual and community psychological resilience and promising approaches to working with people experiencing emerging climate-related disorders. Beyond clinical care, mental health professionals can lead on climate action and sustainability in health care and can research and educate on the health effects of climate change.","['1 Mental Health Programme, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Herston, Queensland, Australia.', '2 School of Public Health, University of Queensland, Herston, Queensland, Australia.', ""3 Department of Psychological Medicine, Sydney Children's Hospital Network, Westmead, New South Wales, Australia."", '4 School of Clinical Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', '5 Metro North Mental Health Service, Herston, Queensland, Australia.', '6 Queensland Centre for Mental Health Research, Queensland Health, Wacol, Queensland, Australia.', '7 Child Health Research Centre, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', ""8 Child and Youth Mental Health Service, Children's Health Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia."", '9 School of Public Health, University of Queensland, Herston, Queensland, Australia. f.charlson@uq.edu.au.', '10 Queensland Centre for Mental Health Research, Queensland Health, Wacol, Queensland, Australia. f.charlson@uq.edu.au.', '11 Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, Department of Global Health, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. f.charlson@uq.edu.au.']","Tara J Crandon, Cybele Dey, James G Scott, Hannah J Thomas, Suhailah Ali, Fiona J Charlson, ",Nature human behaviour,2022 Nov,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36385181,nature
82,The mental health impacts of receiving a breast cancer diagnosis: A meta-analysis,"Background:
        
      
      Receiving a breast cancer diagnosis can be a turning point with negative impacts on mental health, treatment and prognosis. This meta-analysis sought to determine the nature and prevalence of clinically significant psychological distress-related symptoms in the wake of a breast cancer diagnosis. Methods:
        
      
      Ten databases were searched between March and August 2020. Thirty-nine quantitative studies were meta-analysed. Results:
        
      
      The prevalence of clinically significant symptoms was 39% for non-specific distress (n = 13), 34% for anxiety (n = 19), 31% for post-traumatic stress (n = 7) and 20% for depression (n = 25). No studies reporting breast cancer patients' well-being in our specific time frame were found. Conclusion:
        
      
      Mental health can be impacted in at least four domains following a diagnosis of breast cancer and such effects are commonplace.

83,"Population-Based Approaches to Mental Health: History, Strategies, and Evidence","There is growing recognition in the fields of public health and mental health services research that the provision of clinical services to individuals is not a viable approach to meeting the mental health needs of a population. Despite enthusiasm for the notion of population-based approaches to mental health, concrete guidance about what such approaches entail is lacking, and evidence of their effectiveness has not been integrated. Drawing from research and scholarship across multiple disciplines, this review provides a concrete definition of population-based approaches to mental health, situates these approaches within their historical context in the United States, and summarizes the nature of these approaches and their evidence. These approaches span three domains: (a) social, economic, and environmental policy interventions that can be implemented by legislators and public agency directors, (b) public health practice interventions that can be implemented by public health department officials, and (c) health care system interventions that can be implemented by hospital and health care system leaders.","['1 Department of Health Management and Policy, Dornsife School of Public Health, Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA; email: jpp46@drexel.edu.', '2 Mental Health America, Alexandria, Virginia 22314, USA.', '3 Department of Community Health and Prevention, Dornsife School of Public Health, Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.']","Jonathan Purtle, Katherine L Nelson, Nathaniel Z Counts, Michael Yudell, ",Annual review of public health,2020 Apr 2,health care system design; mental health; population health; psychiatric epidemiology; public health practice; public policy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31905323,PMC
84,Association between Urban Greenspace and Health: A Systematic Review of Literature,"The current review aimed to explore the association between urban greenspaces and health indicators. In particular, our aims were to analyze the association between publicly accessible urban greenspaces exposure and two selected health outcomes (objectively measured physical activity (PA) and mental health outcomes (MH)). Two electronic databases-PubMed/Medline and Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE)-were searched from 1 January 2000 to 30 September 2020. Only articles in English were considered. Out of 356 retrieved articles, a total of 34 papers were included in our review. Of those, 15 assessed the association between urban greenspace and PA and 19 dealt with MH. Almost all the included studies found a positive association between urban greenspace and both PA and MH, while a few demonstrated a non-effect or a negative effect on MH outcomes. However, only guaranteeing access is not enough. Indeed, important elements are maintenance, renovation, closeness to residential areas, planning of interactive activities, and perceived security aspects. Overall, despite some methodological limitations of the included studies, the results have shown almost univocally that urban greenspaces harbour potentially beneficial effects on physical and mental health and well-being.","['1 School of Medicine, University Vita-Salute San Raffaele, 20132 Milan, Italy.', '2 Architecture, Built Environment and Construction Engineering Department, Politecnico di Milano, 20133 Milan, Italy.', '3 Department of Public Health, Experimental and Forensic Medicine, University of Pavia, 20158 Milan, Italy.']","Vincenza Gianfredi, Maddalena Buffoli, Andrea Rebecchi, Roberto Croci, Aurea Oradini-Alacreu, Giuseppe Stirparo, Alessio Marino, Anna Odone, Stefano Capolongo, Carlo Signorelli, ",International journal of environmental research and public health,2021 May 12,anxiety; depression; green areas; green infrastructures; mental health; non-communicable diseases; physical activity; stress; urban greenery; urban health.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34066187,mdpi

      Mental health nursing skills and knowledge are vital for the provision of high-quality healthcare across all settings. Negative attitudes of nurses, towards both mental illness and mental health nursing as a profession, limit recognition of the value of these skills and knowledge. Experts by Experience have a significant role in enhancing mental health nursing education. The impact of this involvement on attitudes to mental health nursing has not been well researched. Aim:
        
      
      To explore the impact of Expert by Experience-led teaching on students' perceptions of mental health nursing. Methods:
        
      
      Qualitative exploratory study involving focus groups with nursing students from five European countries and Australia. Results:
        
      
      Following Expert by Experience-led teaching, participants described more positive views towards mental health nursing skills and knowledge in three main ways: learning that mental health is everywhere, becoming better practitioners, and better appreciation of mental health nursing. Conclusions:
        
      
      Experts by experience contribute to promoting positive attitudinal change in nursing students towards mental health nursing skills and knowledge.

86,Twenty-One Reasons for Implementing the Act-Belong-Commit-'ABCs of Mental Health' Campaign,"While there has been increased attention worldwide on mental health promotion over the past two decades, what is lacking in many countries around the globe is practical knowledge of what constitutes a population-wide mental health promotion campaign, and how such a campaign can be implemented. This paper provides such knowledge based on the development, implementation and evaluation of the Act-Belong-Commit campaign, the world's first comprehensive population-wide public mental health promotion campaign which was launched in 2008 in Western Australia. Given the learnings from the full-scale implementation and evaluation of the campaign in Western Australia and its expansion nationally and internationally, along with the continuing and expanding evidence base for the campaign constructs, we crystallise 21 reasons why jurisdictions who wish to achieve the goals of the WHO and adopt the recommendations of the European framework on mental health and wellbeing should consider adopting or adapting Act-Belong-Commit when considering implementing a public mental health promotion campaign.","['1 School of Human Sciences, University of Western Australia, Perth 6009, Australia.', '2 Department of Psychology, University of Copenhagen, 1165 Copenhagen, Denmark.', '3 National Centre for Student Equity in Higher Education, Curtin University, Perth 6102, Australia.', '4 National Institute of Public Health, University of Southern Denmark, 5230 Odense, Denmark.', '5 Western Australian Department of Education, Perth 6004, Australia.', '6 School of Public Health, Curtin University, Perth 6102, Australia.']","Robert J Donovan, Vibeke J Koushede, Catherine F Drane, Carsten Hinrichsen, Julia Anwar-McHenry, Line Nielsen, Amberlee Nicholas, Charlotte Meilstrup, Ziggi Ivan Santini, ",International journal of environmental research and public health,2021 Oct 21,Act-Belong-Commit; mental health and wellbeing; mental health promotion.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34769615,mdpi
87,Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Mental Health and Mental Health Care During The COVID-19 Pandemic,"During the pandemic, the overall mental health of the US population declined. Given higher rates of COVID-19 infections and deaths experienced by communities of color along with greater exposure to pandemic-related stressors (e.g., unemployment, food insecurity), we expect that the decline in mental health during the pandemic was more pronounced among Black, Hispanic, and Asian adults, with these groups also having less access to mental health services. We examine two nationally representative US surveys: the 2019 National Household Interview Survey (NHIS; N = 30,368) and the 2020-2021 Household Pulse Survey (HPS; N = 1,677,238). We find mental health of Black, Hispanic, and Asian respondents worsened relative to White respondents during the pandemic, with significant increases in depression and anxiety among racialized minorities compared to Whites. There is also evidence of especially high mental health burden for Black adults around the murder of George Floyd by police and for Asian adults around the murder of six Asian women in Atlanta. White respondents are most likely to receive professional mental health care before and during the pandemic, and Black, Hispanic, and Asian respondents demonstrate higher levels of unmet mental health care needs during the pandemic than White respondents. Our results indicate that within the current environment, White adults are at a large and systemic advantage buffering them from unexpected crises-like the COVID-19 pandemic. Without targeted interventions, the long-term social consequences of the pandemic and other co-occurring events (e.g., death of Black and Hispanic people by police) will likely include widening mental health disparities between racial/ethnic groups.","['1 Department of Sociology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Heritage Hall 460, 1401 University Blvd., Birmingham, AL, 35233, USA. mthomeer@uab.edu.', '2 Department of Sociology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Heritage Hall 460, 1401 University Blvd., Birmingham, AL, 35233, USA.', '3 Department of Sociology, Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, OH, USA.']","Mieke Beth Thomeer, Myles D Moody, Jenjira Yahirun, ",Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities,2023 Apr,Racism; Race/ethnicity; Mental health; COVID-19 pandemic; Mental health care; Health disparities.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35318615,PMC
88,What is good mental health? A scoping review,"Promotion of good mental health in young people with and without mental disorders has received little empirical research attention and interventions for improving mental health in young people are not well established. This situation could be explained among other reasons due to the difficulties to define and operationalise what good mental health is. The current manuscript, produced by the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology Thematic Working Group on the Prevention of Mental Disorders and Mental Health Promotion (ECNP TWG PMD-MHP), presents a critical review of the available operationalizations for good mental health. A pragmatic conceptual operationalisation of good mental health is a much-needed step towards more standardised research in this field. Good mental health can be defined as a state of well-being that allows individuals to cope with the normal stresses of life and function productively. Universal and selective interventions are suitable to promote mental health. Core domains that define good mental health encompass: (i) mental health literacy, (ii) attitude towards mental disorders, (iii) self-perceptions and values, (iv) cognitive skills, (v) academic/ occupational performance, (vi) emotions, (vii) behaviours, (viii) self-management strategies, (ix) social skills, (x) family and significant relationships (xi) physical health, (xii) sexual health, (xiii) meaning of life, (xiv) and quality of life. These domains should be widely traceable in the literature and can be used to conduct further empirical research in the field of good mental health. Such data can lead to more robust evidence to identify and establish the pathways to follow in order to improve mental health.","[""1 Early Psychosis: Interventions and Clinical-detection (EPIC) lab, Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK; OASIS service, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK; Department of Brain and Behavioural Sciences, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy; National Institute for Health Research, Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.

      Mental health disorders are highly prevalent across countries. They increase over time and impose a severe burden on individuals and societies. Objective:
        
      
      This paper examines the evolution of mental health over a period of 15 years, paying special attention on the impact of the most recent economic downturn and subsequent recovery, in Spain. Method:
        
      
      We use data coming from the National Health Surveys of 2006/2007, 2011/2012 and 2016/2017. Mental health is proxied by two measures, doctor-diagnosed mental disorder and psychological distress (based on the 12-item General Health Questionnaire). To account for the relationship between the two mental health indicators, we estimate a bivariate probit model. The potential endogeneity of unemployment status is considered. Results:
        
      
      We observe different patterns of the two mental health indicators over time. Psychological distress in men increased during recession years, but slightly decreased among women. Diagnosed mental disorders declined during the peak years of the crisis. Unemployment is a major risk factor for mental distress. Irrespective of the economic conditions, belonging to a higher social class acts as a buffer against psychological distress for women, but not for men. The remaining determinants acted as expected. Women declared worse psychological health than men, and were also more often diagnosed with mental disorders. Having a partner had a protective impact, while providing intensive care to a dependent relative exerted the opposite effect. Education acted as buffer against the onset of psychological distress in women. Conclusion:
        
      
      Even though the need for mental healthcare increased during the recession, the fact that fewer people were diagnosed suggests that barriers to accessing mental healthcare may be aggravated during the crisis. Policies aiming to tackle the challenges posed by the high prevalence of mental disorders have to be particularly attentive to changes in individuals' socioeconomic situation, including education, unemployment and social class.","['1 Department of Economics, Faculty of Economics and Business Administration, Universitat de Barcelona, BEAT and CAEPS, 08034, Barcelona, Spain. alexandrina.stoyanova@ub.edu.', '2 Department of Quantitative Methods in Economics, Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, 35017, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.']","Alexandrina Stoyanova, Jaime Pinilla, ",Applied health economics and health policy,2020 Apr,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31761976,springer

Nurses will come into frequent contact with people experiencing mental health issues in hospitals and in the community. Mental state assessment is a tool that enables nurses to develop an understanding of an individual's mental health that will be universally recognised across healthcare services. This article provides an outline of the various elements involved in a mental state assessment, so that clinicians such as non-mental health nurses can identify people experiencing deteriorating mental health.","['1 Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, England.']","Helen Rees, ",Nursing standard (Royal College of Nursing (Great Britain) : 1987),2021 Jun 2,assessment; delusion; depression; mental health; obsessive compulsive disorder; post-traumatic stress disorder; postnatal depression.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33843167,NO TEXT

96,Mental health problems in the general population during and after the first lockdown phase due to the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic: rapid review of multi-wave studies,"Aims:
        
      
      The SARS-Cov-2 pandemic and the lockdown response are assumed to have increased mental health problems in general populations compared to pre-pandemic times. The aim of this paper is to review studies on the course of mental health problems during and after the first lockdown phase. Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a rapid review of multi-wave studies in general populations with time points during and after the first lockdown phase. Repeated cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that utilised validated instruments were included. The main outcome was whether indicators of mental health problems have changed during and after the first lockdown phase. The study was registered with PROSPERO No. CRD42020218640. Results:
        
      
      Twenty-three studies with 56 indicators were included in the qualitative review. Studies that reported data from pre-pandemic assessments through lockdown indicated an increase in mental health problems. During lockdown, no uniform trend could be identified. After lockdown, mental health problems decreased slightly. Conclusions:
        
      
      As mental health care utilisation indicators and data on suicides do not suggest an increase in demand during the first lockdown phase, we regard the increase in mental health problems as general distress that is to be expected during a global health crisis. Several methodological, pandemic-related, response-related and health policy-related factors need to be considered when trying to gain a broader perspective on the impact of the first wave of the pandemic and the first phase of lockdown on general populations' mental health.","['1 Bern University Hospital for Mental Health, Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation, Bern, Switzerland.', '2 Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', '3 Department of Health Professions, Bern University of Applied Sciences, Bern, Switzerland.', '4 University of Leipzig, Institute of Social Medicine, Occupational Health and Public Health (ISAP), Leipzig, Germany.']","Dirk Richter, Steffi Riedel-Heller, Simeon Joel Zürcher, ",Epidemiology and psychiatric sciences,2021 Mar 9,Mental health; Pandemic; Rapid review; SARS-Cov-2.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33685551,PMC
97,Current situation and comparison of school mental health in ASEAN countries,"School-based mental health interventions are considered to have potential for the promotion of mental health in developing countries. We held a workshop to discuss the promotion of mental health in schools in southeast Asian countries. This review report aimed to summarize the current situation of school mental health in Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries as reported by their representatives in this workshop. To summarize the current situation of ASEAN countries in relation to school mental health, we qualitatively analyzed the content of the discussions from four perspectives: (i) laws and regulations: (ii) mental health services; (iii) teacher training on mental health; (iv) mental health education for students. With regard to school mental health laws and regulations, this report could not provide clear conclusions because the laws were reported through the personal understanding of the public officers. Our results show that mental health services in schools are centered on professionals such as guidance counselors, although the coverage varied among the different ASEAN countries. Only Singapore conducted mental health training for teachers in a comprehensive way, and the number of people who were actually trained in other countries was very limited. Cambodia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand included mental health education for students in health education or life skills subjects.","['1 Health Administration Center, Gifu University, Gifu, Japan.', '2 Nagasaki University school of tropical medicine and global health, Nagasaki, Japan.', '3 Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization Tropical Medicine and Public Health Network, Bangkok, Thailand.', '4 Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyu, Nishihara, Japan.']","Akihiro Nishio, Machi Kakimoto, Tempongko Ma Sandra Bermardo, Jun Kobayashi, ",Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,2020 Apr,ASEAN; mental disease; school; school health; school mental health.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31886939,wiley
98,"Arts, mental distress, mental health functioning & life satisfaction: fixed-effects analyses of a nationally-representative panel study","Background:
        
      
      Arts engagement within communities is ubiquitous across cultures globally and previous research has suggested its benefits for mental health and wellbeing. However, it remains unclear whether these benefits are driven by arts engagement itself or by important confounders such as socio-economic status (SES), childhood arts engagement, previous mental health, personality, or self-selection bias. The aim of this study is to use fixed effects models that account for unidentified time-constant confounding measures to examine the longitudinal association between arts (frequency of both arts participation and cultural attendance), mental distress, mental health functioning and life satisfaction. Methods:
        
      
      Data from 23,660 individuals (with a mean age of 47 years) included in the UK Understanding Society wave 2 (2010-2012) and wave 5 (2013-2015) were analyzed. Aside from controlling for all time-constant variables using fixed-effects models, we additionally adjusted for time-varying demographic factors (e.g. age and marital status), health behaviors and social support variables. Results:
        
      
      After controlling for all time-constant variables and identified time-varying confounders, frequent arts participation and cultural attendance were associated with lower levels of mental distress and higher levels of life satisfaction, with arts participation additionally associated with better mental health functioning. Health-related and social time-varying factors were shown partly but not wholly to explain the observed associations. Conclusion:
        
      
      Arts engagement amongst the population as a whole may help enhance positive mental health and life satisfaction, and protect against mental distress. These results are independent of a wide range of time-constant confounding factors.","['1 Department of Sociology, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', '2 Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London, 1-19 Torrington Place, London, WC1E 7HB, UK.', '3 Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London, 1-19 Torrington Place, London, WC1E 7HB, UK. d.fancourt@ucl.ac.uk.']","Senhu Wang, Hei Wan Mak, Daisy Fancourt, ",BMC public health,2020 Feb 11,Arts engagement; Fixed-effects; Longitudinal study; Mental health; Wellbeing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32046670,PMC

      Children and youth are often challenged to maintain well-being, positive behavior, and social participation. Objective:
        
      
      To identify evidence for occupational therapy interventions for children and youth with and at risk for mental health concerns. Data sources:
        
      
      Articles published in English-language peer-reviewed journals between January 2010 and March 2017 identified through searches of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, OTseeker, and Cochrane databases. Study selection and data collectio:
        
      
      : The methodology in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses was used to complete the review. Of 5,310 articles screened by title and abstract, 357 were retrieved for full-text review, and 62 met inclusion criteria. Articles describing interventions that were activity or occupation based were included. Conference proceedings, non-peer reviewed publications, dissertations, theses, and presentations were excluded. Findings:
        
      
      Of the 62 studies included in the review, 20 (32%) were Level I studies, 22 (36%) were Level II studies, and 20 (32%) were Level III studies. Articles were categorized by type: outdoor camps, video and computer games, productive occupations and life skills, meditation, animal-assisted interventions, creative arts, play, sports, and yoga. Moderate to strong evidence supports the use of yoga and sports. Moderate-strength evidence supports the use of play and creative arts. Evidence for the use of animal-assisted interventions, meditation, video and computer games, and productive occupations was of low strength. Conclusion and relevance:
        
      
      Substantial evidence exists to support the use of activity- and occupation-based interventions to address the mental health, behavioral, and social participation concerns of children and youth. Occupational therapy practitioners should match the desired outcome of therapy with the appropriate intervention to provide the best and most effective services to their clients. What this article adds:
        
      
      This review provides additional support for the use of activity- and occupation-based interventions (i.e., those that involve active participation) to improve the behavior, social participation, and mental health of children and youth.","['1 Susan M.

117,Urbanization and mental health as a research problem in Latin America (with a focus on Brazil),"Purpose of review:
        
      
      The basic hypothesis of this paper is that, in Latin America, the nature of the set of variables or determinants regarding the relationships of urbanization (and correlated processes of social change, modernization, acculturation, and economic inclusion) and mental health varies with the political context or historical phase considered. To assess the validity of the hypothesis, I propose a periodization of the economic, political, and social changes that occurred in Latin America in the past decades. Recent findings:
        
      
      A brief review of recent studies on social determinants of mental health (with a focus on Brazil), considering research findings by historical context, shows that urbanization-modernization-migration variables were more present in the literature in the decades of 1980 and 1990, whereas social inequity factors (gender, ethnicity/race, and racism) came to be dominant as a research question after the year 2000. Summary:
        
      
      New approaches of the mental health situation of peripheral societies such as those in the Latin American continent have gone beyond the urban environment as a determinant and start to consider social determination processes and political contexts.","['1 Institute of Advanced Studies at the Universidade de São Paulo (USP), São Paulo.', '2 Instituto de Saúde Coletiva at the Universidade Federal da Bahia (UFBA), Salvador.', '3 Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq), Lago Sul, Brazil.']","Naomar Almeida-Filho, ",Current opinion in psychiatry,2021 May 1,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33560021,journals.lww

120,Fraternity in Humanity and Global Mental Health,"From the historical point of view, the concept of mental health is both in positive and negative terms very much intertwined with religion. We might say that, up to the modern age, there was no other treatment of what we now know as mental illnesses apart from the one offered by religion. Of course, in many cases superstition and brutality prevailed (they always come together, indeed); but, again, we may still look into religious tradition and find many inspiring examples that might help us solve some important problems regarding the mental health issues. The most important ones are, we find, those connected with interpersonal and social context of both their etiology and treatment. Following this line of thinking, we have selected two well-known texts from the New Testament in order to offer an interpretation of them which might answer some questions that we find are fundamentally important for dealing with such a broad theme regarding the relation between religious teachings and mental health.","['1 Faculty of Orthodox Theology, Mije Kovačevića 11b, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.']","Grigorije Durić, Vukašin Milićević, ",Psychiatria Danubina,2021 Spring-Summer,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35026814,NO TEXT (not hosted on top 3 sites)
121,Unemployment among young people and mental health: A systematic review,"Aim: The aim of this systematic review is to obtain a better understanding of the association between unemployment among young people and mental health. Methods: After screening the title and abstract of 794 articles drawn from four electronic databases, 52 articles remained for full-text reading. Of these, 20 studies met the inclusion criteria and were assessed on methodological quality. All steps were performed independently by two reviewers. Finally, a total of 17 articles were included in the systematic review. Results: Analysis of cross-sectional studies (N = 5) showed an association between unemployment among young people and mental health. An effect of unemployment on mental health was found when considering cohort studies (N = 12) that did not control for confounders (7/7). When controlling for confounders except mental health at baseline, this effect decreased in most studies leading to mixed results, although the majority (6/8) still found an effect. However, when taking mental health at baseline into account as one of the confounders, only a minority of studies (3/8) found a significant effect of unemployment on mental health. Conclusions: This systematic review showed an association between unemployment among young people and mental health. However, whether there is a causal relationship is less clear. More evidence from, for example, natural experiments and longitudinal studies that control for confounding variables, especially mental health at baseline, is required to better understand the association and potential causation between unemployment among young people and mental health.","['1 Department of Learning, Informatics, Management and Ethics, Karolinska Institutet, Sweden.', '2 Department of Public health Sciences, Karolinska Institutet, Public Health Agency of Sweden, Sweden.']","Vicky H M Bartelink, Kyaw Zay Ya, Karin Guldbrandsson, Sven Bremberg, ",Scandinavian journal of public health,2020 Jul,Unemployment; anxiety; depression; mental health; systematic review; young people; youth.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31291827,sagepub

The LFP-B is ultra-brief, typically delivered in as few as three sessions (two assessment sessions followed by a video feedback session), with the aim of reducing children's mental health symptomatology by enhancing the coparenting relationship. We review literature on systemic family therapies and provide a rationale for including coparents and children in child mental health care. We then provide a rationale for using behavioral observations and video feedback in treatment, drawing on research in related family-based treatments (e.g., parent-child therapies).

      A total of 46 studies (from 21 different countries spanning 6 continents) satisfied inclusion criteria. The worldwide pooled prevalence of any personality disorder was 7.8% (95% CI 6.1-9.5). Rates were greater in high-income countries (9.6%, 95% CI 7.9-11.3%) compared with LMICs (4.3%, 95% CI 2.6-6.1%). In univariate meta-regressions, significant heterogeneity was partly attributable to study design (two-stage v. one-stage assessment), county income (high-income countries v. LMICs) and interview administration (clinician v. trained graduate). In multiple meta-regression analysis, study design remained a significant predictor of heterogeneity. Global rates of cluster A, B and C personality disorders were 3.8% (95% CI 3.2, 4.4%), 2.8% (1.6, 3.7%) and 5.0% (4.2, 5.9%). Conclusions:
        
      
      Personality disorders are prevalent globally. Nevertheless, pooled prevalence rates should be interpreted with caution due to high levels of heterogeneity. More large-scale studies with standardised methodologies are now needed to increase our understanding of population needs and regional variations.","['1 Grant Writer and Honorary Research Fellow, Centre for Mental Health and Wellbeing Research, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick; and Research and Innovation Department, Caludon Centre, Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership Trust, UK.', '2 Psychology Department, Istanbul Medeniyet University, Turkey.', '3 Principal Research Fellow, Orygen, The National Centre of Excellence in Youth Mental Health, The University of Melbourne, Australia; and Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, UK.', '4 Professor of Psychiatry, Institute for Mental Health, Birmingham University; and the Barberry, National Centre for Mental Health, UK.', '5 Professorial Fellow and Head of Personality Disorder Research, Orygen, The National Centre of Excellence in Youth Mental Health; and Centre for Youth Mental Health, The University of Melbourne, Australia.', '6 Professor and Director of the Centre for Mental Health and Wellbeing Research, Centre for Mental Health and Wellbeing Research, University of Warwick, UK.', '7 PhD student, Division of Mental Health and Wellbeing, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, UK.', '8 Associate Clinical Professor of Forensic Psychiatry, Division of Mental Health and Wellbeing, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, UK.']","Catherine Winsper, Ayten Bilgin, Andrew Thompson, Steven Marwaha, Andrew M Chanen, Swaran P Singh, Ariel Wang, Vivek Furtado, ",The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,2020 Feb,LMIC; Personality disorder; meta-analysis; prevalence; systematic review.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31298170,NO TEXT (not hosted on top 3 sites)
125,Mental health impacts of environmental exposures: A scoping review of evaluative instruments,"To date, much of the health focus of environmental policy has been on preventing physical health impacts of environmental exposures. Recent research has however highlighted increasingly concurrent mental health effects and its consideration is an emerging requirement for many governments and their agencies, yet there are limited universal mental health assessment tools for environmental exposures. This paper details the findings of a scoping review that evaluated assessment tools used to measure psychological impacts from environmental exposures and pollution, as reported in recent peer-reviewed literature (2000-2022). Across the 126 papers identified in our review, a wide range of tools to assess mental health impact were identified. We document a clear recent upswing of research interest in the mental and psychological impacts of environmental exposures, and an overarching concern for air pollution from industry, traffic, and fires. A majority of studies utilised standardised assessment instruments, but there was little consistency in the way that these were combined or deployed. The dominant mental health outcomes of interest in these studies were depression, anxiety, and mental and psychiatric health. The findings of the review identify a need and opportunity to develop a best-practice approach to consistently assess the mental health impacts arising from environmental exposures. Future work is needed to define the most appropriate choice and application of assessment tools to evaluate adverse mental health impacts from environmental exposures. This will support a more universal, coordinated and cross-jurisdiction approach for the assessment, quantification and targeted response to addressing mental health impacts arising from environmental exposures.","['1 Australian Centre for Housing Research, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide 5005, Australia.', '2 UniSA Creative, University of South Australia, Adelaide 5000, Australia.', '3 Centre of Research Excellence in Healthy Housing, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, The University of Melbourne, Parkville 3010, Australia.', '4 Environment Protection Authority Victoria, Centre for Applied Sciences, Ernest Jones Drive, Macleod, Melbourne, Victoria 3085, Australia.

126,"Messaging in Biological Psychiatry: Misrepresentations, Their Causes, and Potential Consequences","Most experts in the field of psychiatry recognize that neuroscience advances have yet to be translated into clinical practice. The main message delivered to laypeople, however, is that mental disorders are brain diseases cured by scientifically designed medications. Here we describe how this misleading message is generated. We summarize the academic studies describing how biomedical observations are often misrepresented in the scientific literature through various forms of data embellishment, publication biases favoring initial and positive studies, improper interpretations, and exaggerated conclusions. These misrepresentations also affect biological psychiatry and are spread through mass media documents. Exacerbated competition, hyperspecialization, and the need to obtain funding for research projects might drive scientists to misrepresent their findings. Moreover, journalists are unaware that initial studies, even when positive and promising, are inherently uncertain. Journalists preferentially cover them and almost never inform the public when those studies are disconfirmed by subsequent research. This explains why reductionist theories about mental health often persist in mass media even though the scientific claims that have been put forward to support them have long been contradicted. These misrepresentations affect the care of patients. Indeed, studies show that a neuro-essentialist conceptualization of mental disorders negatively affects several aspects of stigmatization, reduces the chances of patients' healing, and overshadows psychotherapeutic and social approaches that have been found effective in alleviating mental suffering. Public information about mental health should avoid these reporting biases and give equal consideration to the biological, psychological, and social aspects of mental health.","['1 From the Institute of Neurodegenerative Diseases and CNRS UMR, University of Bordeaux.']","Estelle Dumas-Mallet, Francois Gonon, ",Harvard review of psychiatry,2020 Nov/Dec,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33156157,PMC

Thirty-three children of both sexes between 11 and 14 years were randomized into trained group (n = 18) and untrained group (n = 15). The training was performed for 8 weeks. Then, before and after 48 h of training period of both groups were submitted to find the mental health, cognition, motor coordination test, and physical fitness. Our results demonstrate that the aquatic exercise program significantly improved the depression parameters (p = 0.048), stress (p = 0.039), cognitive flexibility (p = 0.042) and selective attention (p = 0.047). In relation to motor coordination and physical fitness, the results showed significant improvements in the coordination of lower limbs laterality (p = 0.05), flexibility (p = 0.049), and abdominal resistance (p = 0.037).

128,Mental health stigma and professional help-seeking attitudes a comparison between Cuba and Germany,"Globally the burden due to mental disorders is continuously increasing. Still, professional help-seeking behavior is not fully understood. To conceive cultural determinants of help-seeking is crucial to reduce personal and social costs of (untreated) mental disorders. The current study investigates mental health stigma and help-seeking attitudes in a Cuban (n = 195) and a German (n = 165) sample. In a questionnaire survey we asked for attitudes towards mental illness and professional help-seeking in the general Cuban and German populations. The cultural context was associated with mental health stigma and professional help-seeking attitudes. Interestingly, Cuban participants reported stronger mental health stigma and more willingness to seek help. In multiple hierarchical regression analyses, community attitudes towards the mentally ill significantly predicted help-seeking attitudes, especially in the Cuban sample. Only in the German sample, more negative individual beliefs about mental illness predicted more self-stigma on help-seeking. Beyond that, cultural context moderated the association between mental health stigma and help-seeking attitudes with a stronger association between the measures in the German sample. However, gender did not predict help-seeking attitudes and self-stigma on help-seeking and no interactions between community attitudes, cultural context, and gender were found in the prediction of help-seeking attitudes. Similarities and differences between the samples are discussed in the light of the cultural contexts and peculiarities of the current samples. Concluding, implications of the current findings are reviewed.","['1 Division of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Department of Psychology and Sport Science, University of Münster, Münster, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.', '2 Division of Clinical Psychology, Department of Psychology, University of Havana, Ciudad de La Habana, La Habana, Cuba.', '3 Division of Psychiatry and Psychology, Outpatient Clinic of Mental Health Service, University Hospital General Calixto García Iñiguez, Ciudad de La Habana, La Habana, Cuba.']","Laura Nohr, Alexis Lorenzo Ruiz, Juan E Sandoval Ferrer, Ulrike Buhlmann, ",PloS one,2021 Feb 11,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33571232,PMC

The focus of our attention has been on the specific physical condition rather than the patient as a whole. Less attention has been given to psychological health and how that can contribute to physical health and disease. However, there is now an increasing appreciation of how psychological health can contribute not only in a negative way to cardiovascular disease (CVD) but also in a positive way to better cardiovascular health and reduced cardiovascular risk.

132,Optimising strategies to address mental ill-health in doctors and medical students: 'Care Under Pressure' realist review and implementation guidance,"Background:
        
      
      Mental ill-health in health professionals, including doctors, is a global and growing concern. The existing literature on interventions that offer support, advice and/or treatment to sick doctors has not yet been synthesised in a way that considers the complexity and heterogeneity of the interventions, and the many dimensions of the problem. We (1) reviewed interventions to tackle doctors' and medical students' mental ill-health and its impacts on the clinical workforce and patient care-drawing on diverse literature sources and engaging iteratively with diverse stakeholder perspectives-and (2) produced recommendations that support the tailoring, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of contextually sensitive strategies to tackle mental ill-health and its impacts. Methods:
        
      
      Realist literature review consistent with the RAMESES quality and reporting standards. Sources for inclusion were identified through bibliographic database searches supplemented by purposive searches-resulting also from engagement with stakeholders. Data were extracted from included articles and subjected to realist analysis to identify (i) mechanisms causing mental ill-health in doctors and medical students and relevant contexts or circumstances when these mechanisms were likely to be 'triggered' and (ii) 'guiding principles' and features underpinning the interventions and recommendations discussed mostly in policy document, reviews and commentaries. Results:
        
      
      One hundred seventy-nine records were included. Most were from the USA (45%) and were published since 2009 (74%). The analysis showed that doctors were more likely to experience mental ill-health when they felt isolated or unable to do their job and when they feared repercussions of help-seeking. Healthy staff were necessary for excellent patient care. Interventions emphasising relationships and belonging were more likely to promote wellbeing. Interventions creating a people-focussed working culture, balancing positive/negative performance and acknowledging positive/negative aspects of a medical career helped doctors to thrive. The way that interventions were implemented seemed critically important. Doctors and medical students needed to have confidence in an intervention for the intervention to be effective. Conclusions:
        
      
      Successful interventions to tackle doctors' and students' mental ill-health are likely to be multidimensional and multilevel and involve multiple stakeholders. Evaluating and improving existing interventions is likely to be more effective than developing new ones. Our evidence synthesis provides a basis on which to do this.

133,Mental health status in veterans residing in rural versus non-rural areas: results from the veterans' health study,"Background:
        
      
      The majority of Veterans Affair (VA) hospitals are in urban areas. We examined whether veterans residing in rural areas have lower mental health service use and poorer mental health status. Methods:
        
      
      Veterans with at least 1 warzone deployment in central and northeastern Pennsylvania were randomly selected for an interview. Mental health status, including PTSD, major depression, alcohol abuse and mental health global severity, were assessed using structured interviews. Psychiatric service use was based on self-reported utilization in the past 12 months. Results were compared between veterans residing in rural and non-rural areas. Data were also analyzed using multivariate logistic regression to minimize the influence by confounding factors. Results:
        
      
      A total of 1730 subjects (55% of the eligible veterans) responded to the survey and 1692 of them had complete geocode information. Those that did not have this information (n = 38), were excluded from some analyses. Veterans residing in rural areas were older, more often of the white race, married, and experienced fewer stressful events. In comparison to those residing in non-rural areas, veterans residing in rural areas had lower global mental health severity scores; they also had fewer mental health visits. In multivariate logistic regression, rural residence was associated with lower service use, but not with PTSD, major depression, alcohol abuse, and global mental health severity score after adjusting confounding factors (e.g., age, gender, marital status and education). Conclusions:
        
      
      Rural residence is associated with lower mental health service use, but not with poor mental health in veterans with former warzone deployment, suggesting rural residence is possibly protective.","['1 Clinical Psychology Department, William James College, Newton, MA, 02459, USA.', '2 School of Social Work, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, 70112, USA.', '3 Department of Sociology, Kent State University, Kent, OH, 44242, USA.', '4 Ophthalmology Service, Geisinger Clinic, Mount Pocono, PA, 18344, USA.', '5 Department of Population Health Sciences, Geisinger Clinic, 100 N.

It argues that two factors drew student mental health to the attention of medical professionals across this period: first, it argues that the post-war interest in mental illness drew attention to students, who were seen to be the luminaries of the future, investing their wellbeing with particular social importance. Second, it argues that the development of university health services made students increasingly visible, endorsing the view that higher education posed distinctive yet shared mental challenges to young people. The article charts the expansion of services and maps the implications of the visibility of student mental distress for post-war British universities. It suggests that claims that British higher education is currently in the midst of an unprecedented mental health ""crisis"" should be seen within this broader historical context, for while the contours of the debates around student mental health have shifted substantially, evidence that there was anxiety around student mental wellbeing in the immediate post-war years undermines accusations that contemporary students constitute a unique ""snowflake generation.""",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Sarah Crook, ",Journal of the history of medicine and allied sciences,2020 Apr 1,Higher education; mental illness; post-war Britain; psychiatry; students; universities.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31913482,NO TEXT (not hosted on top 3 sites)
136,Reframing Mental Health Ethics,"Mental health ethics has been classically focused on ethical concepts and problems in clinical mental health spaces. Psychiatric and psychotherapeutic ethics are main threads of analysis in this subfield of bioethics. However, ethical issues emerge around mental health and illness both within and beyond clinical settings. In particular, ethical quandaries arise in employment, education, family caregiving, and incarceration of people with mental health conditions outside of the clinical setting. Likewise, ethics are an important consideration within alternative care systems where mentally ill people seek support beyond biomedicine, psychotherapy, and case management. In this article, we argue that our understanding of ""mental health ethics"" should expand to be more inclusive of value questions and conflicts that arise in all areas of the lives of people with mental health conditions, rather than focusing more narrowly on how clinical practitioners and researchers should best respond to ethical quandaries in the delivery of mental healthcare. Community mental health is an ideal space in which to think about such ethical issues, as scholars and practitioners in the field strive to meet not only medical needs but the broader social needs of people with mental health conditions. We begin by providing an overview of psychiatric and psychotherapeutic ethics, and then describe broader applications of ethics in the lives of people experiencing mental illness. We encourage community mental health practitioners and researchers to reconceptualize disciplinary boundaries to consider the vast scope of ethical issues related to mental health in and out of the clinic.","['1 Department of Bioethics, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, 10900 Euclid Avenue, Sears Tower TA200, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA. julia.knopes@case.edu.', '2 Cleveland Clinic Center for Bioethics, Cleveland, USA.']","Julia Knopes, Laura Guidry-Grimes, ",Community mental health journal,2024 Feb,Bioethics; Lived experience; Mental health ethics; Psychiatric ethics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37787887,springer
137,Mental Health Is a Family Affair-Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis on the Associations between Mental Health Problems in Parents and Children during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"As a multidimensional and universal stressor, the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected the mental health of children, adolescents, and adults worldwide. In particular, families faced numerous restrictions and challenges. From the literature, it is well known that parental mental health problems and child mental health outcomes are associated. Hence, this review aims to summarize the current research on the associations of parental mental health symptoms and child mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a systematic literature search in Web of Science (all databases) and identified 431 records, of which 83 articles with data of over 80,000 families were included in 38 meta-analyses. A total of 25 meta-analyses resulted in significant small to medium associations between parental mental health symptoms and child mental health outcomes (r = 0.19 to 0.46, p < 0.05). The largest effects were observed for the associations of parenting stress and child mental health outcomes. A dysfunctional parent-child interaction has been identified as a key mechanism for the transmission of mental disorders. Thus, specific parenting interventions are needed to foster healthy parent-child interactions, to promote the mental health of families, and to reduce the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.","['1 Department of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, Philipps University Marburg, 35032 Marburg, Germany.', '2 Research Unit, Child and Adolescent Mental Health Center, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.', '3 Institute for Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', '4 Mental Health Research Program, The Village, Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.', '5 Division of Psychiatry I, Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, Medical University Innsbruck, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.']","Markus Stracke, Miriam Heinzl, Anne Dorothee Müller, Kristin Gilbert, Anne Amalie Elgaard Thorup, Jean Lillian Paul, Hanna Christiansen, ",International journal of environmental research and public health,2023 Mar 2,COVID-19; children of parents with mental illness; family health; pandemic; parental mental illness; parenting stress; parents with mental illness; transgenerational transmission.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36901492,mdpi
138,"Regulating digital therapeutics for mental health: Opportunities, challenges, and the essential role of psychologists","With so many promising digital therapeutics for anxiety and obsessive-compulsive (OC) spectrum problems, there is an urgent need to consider how evolving regulatory oversight of digital therapeutics is poised to shift how these tools are developed, evaluated, reimbursed, and delivered. In this commentary, we discuss both opportunities and potential pitfalls associated with emerging government regulations of digital therapeutics for mental health, and we consider how applying the traditional 'prescription-based' medical approval paradigm to digital therapeutics for mental health could ultimately undermine and limit the broad accessibility of these software-based innovations that have been explicitly designed to expand the accessibility of care. For example, the vast majority of behavioural and mental health providers do not have 'prescription privileges' (a term originally rooted in pharmacologic practices), and as a result, under current regulations in the U.S. would not be authorized to make FDA-cleared digital therapeutics available to their patients. This is particularly concerning given that most digital therapeutics for mental health are directly rooted in psychological and behavioural science, yet psychologists would not be authorized to incorporate these innovations into their practice. We consider how synchronizing regulatory standards across countries may prove useful, and we conclude by arguing that multidisciplinary teams making regulatory decisions concerning digital therapeutics for mental health must include representation from the discipline and practice of psychology.

139,The implications of parent mental health and wellbeing for parent-child attachment: A systematic review,"Background:
        
      
      Parent mental health and wellbeing may have implications for understanding attachment transmission. In this systematic review, we synthesise the published literature to determine the nature of the relationship between parent mental health and wellbeing and the intergenerational transmission of attachment and to provide recommendations for future research, clinical practice and intervention. Method:
        
      
      Using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) approach, five electronic databases were searched for peer-reviewed empirical studies, published in English. Articles were considered for inclusion if data was collected on adult attachment, child attachment, and a domain of parent mental health/wellbeing. No date parameters were applied to the search strategy. The review was registered with PROPSERO (registration number: CRD42020157247). Results:
        
      
      Eleven studies examining the impact on parent mental health and wellbeing on the intergenerational transmission of attachment were identified for inclusion in this review. Our review found preliminary evidence that parent mental health and wellbeing play a role in the intergenerational transmission of attachment. Other key findings from the review were: evidence quality is mixed due to variable measurement of attachment and mental health; studies have mostly included correlational analysis or do not utilise contemporary methodological approaches to testing mediating or moderating relationships; and literature is largely focused on psychopathology and negative factors of mental health. Conclusions:
        
      
      The limited scope of parent mental health and wellbeing constructs examined in the literature, the sparse use of robust statistical analyses, and the lack of literature in general makes it difficult to draw conclusions on how and why parent mental health impacts attachment transmission.

141,Association of Child and Adolescent Mental Health With Adolescent Health Behaviors in the UK Millennium Cohort,"Importance:
        
      
      There is potential for mental health status to act as a determinant of an individual's ability to engage in healthful lifestyle behaviors. Objective:
        
      
      To investigate the associations of parent-reported mental health problems during childhood and self-reported mental health problems in adolescence with health behaviors in adolescence. Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      This cohort study used data from wave 4 (collected in 2008) and wave 6 (collected in 2015) of the Millennium Cohort Study, a UK population-representative longitudinal study of young people born during 2000 to 2001. Wave 4 included data on parent-reported mental health issues for children at age 7 years. Wave 6 included data on self-reported mental health problems as well as health behaviors for the same children at age 14 years. Data were analyzed July 5, 2020. Exposures:
        
      
      Mental health problems at age 7 years were parent-reported using Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Mental health problems at age 14 years were self-reported using the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire. Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      Health behaviors at age 14 years were the main outcome of interest. Sleep duration; fruit, vegetable, and soft drink consumption; and social media use were self-reported using recall on a typical day. Regression models were calculated for each lifestyle variable, with mental health change from ages 7 to 14 years as the exposure variable. Data were weighted to account for the potential clustering of region of sampling and adjusted for nonresponse. Results:
        
      
      A total of 9369 participants were included in waves 4 and 6 of the Millennium Cohort Study, including 4665 (48.1%) girls and 6014 participants (81.9%) who were born in England. Adolescents who self-reported mental health problems at age 14 years only were less likely to have at least 9 hours of sleep (odds ratio [OR], 0.39; 95% CI, 0.34-0.45) and to consume fruit (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.46-0.65) and vegetables (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.52-0.83) reported greater use of social media (b = 0.62; 95% CI, 0.49-0.75) compared with individuals who did not have mental health problems at both time points. Similarly, those with mental health problems at both time points were less likely to achieve 9 hours sleep (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.51-0.90), consume fruit (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.26-0.58) and vegetables (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.35-0.91), and reported greater social media use (b = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.34-0.91). Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      These findings suggest that the presence of depressive symptoms at ages 7 and 14 years and at age 14 years only were associated with some health behaviors in adolescence. These findings are particularly important given that independent health behaviors can deteriorate and become habitual during adolescence, and adolescence is a known time for the first emergence of mental health problems that continue into adulthood.","['1 Medical Research Council, Epidemiology Unit, Centre for Diet and Activity Research, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', '2 The Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation, Food and Mood Centre, Barwon Health, Deakin University, School of Medicine, Geelong, Australia.', '3 Department of Physical Education, Universidade Estadual Paulista ""Júlio de Mesquita Filho,"" Presidente Prudente, Brazil.', ""4 Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, Department of Psychological Medicine, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", '5 Physiotherapy Department, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill, London, United Kingdom.', '6 Division of Psychology and Mental Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.', '7 NICM Health Research Institute, Western Sydney University, Westmead, Australia.', '8 Centre for Youth Mental Health, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.']","Erin Hoare, Andre O Werneck, Brendon Stubbs, Joseph Firth, Sam Collins, Kirsten Corder, Esther M F van Sluijs, ",JAMA network open,2020 Aug 3,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32777059,PMC
142,Music Therapy in Mental Health and Emotional Diversion of Primary and Secondary School Students,"The purpose of this paper is to provide a group music therapy intervention for elementary and middle school students with mood disorders through music therapy. To explore the improvement of group music therapy on the dysphoria and state of adolescent patients with mood disorders and to explore the relationship with self-identity. A music activity-based mental health education curriculum was designed based on the results of the current survey, while two homogenous classes were selected as the experimental and control classes; subsequently, the experimental teaching of the music activity-based mental health education curriculum was conducted in the experimental class, and the regular school mental health education curriculum was conducted in the control class, and the pre- and postexperimental scale tests were used to analyze that the curriculum of this study had a positive effect of this study's curriculum on elementary school students' positive emotions analyzed through pre- and postexperimental scale tests. The music activity-based mental health education program had a significant positive effect on the overall level of positive emotions of elementary school students, especially in the positive emotion index, happiness index, mental toughness, goal focus, and interpersonal assistance factor. The positive psychology-oriented music activity-based mental health education curriculum is well suited for elementary and middle school students, especially for upper elementary and middle school students. The music activity-based mental health education curriculum realizes the value of applying positive psychology to mental health education efforts at the elementary school level and flexibly uses a variety of related theories to promote positive emotional experiences for elementary and middle school students.","['1 Conservatory of Music, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210000, China.']","Dong Li, ",Occupational therapy international,2022 Jul 8,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35912310,PMC

144,Heatwave and mental health,"Physical health has been associated with ambient temperature and heatwave. With the frequent occurrence of heatwave, the adaptive effects and mechanisms on mental health remain uncertain. On the basis of the China Health and Nutrition Survey, we estimated the relationship between heatwaves and self-assessed mental health scores in the Chinese population aged 50 and above. This study has identified that with each additional heatwave event, mental health scores decreased by an average of 0.027 points, which is equivalent to 0.3% of the average level. Heat is more likely to affect groups with low education, no medical insurance, and living in rural areas. In mechanistic exploration, we found that stress emotion is a fully mediating effect. Heat led to reduced health activities and more frequent drinking, which may lead to lower psychological well-being. Moreover, good dietary preference is a regulator that can help mitigate the adverse effects of heat on mental health. This study corroborates the impact of heat on spiritual welfare, and demonstrates the mechanisms and channels of impact, which can help reduce global economic losses due to mental health problems.","['1 School of Economics, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.

146,Mental Health Impacts of Climate Change on Women: a Scoping Review,"Climate change is the largest threat to human health of the twenty-first century. Women are disproportionately affected by climate change. While the physical health impacts of climate change are an active area of research, works related to the mental health impacts are less developed. Furthermore, the mental health impacts of climate change on women are a particular area of interest due to women's disproportionately negative experiences with climate change and climate change-related events. Therefore, the purpose of this scoping review is to understand what is known from the existing literature regarding the mental health impacts of climate change on women. The methods for this review follow the Arksey and O'Malley framework for a scoping review. By searching databases for publications that discuss women, mental health, and climate change, and screening for relevant work, 20 studies that met inclusion criteria were included in the review. Themes derived from the reviewed studies include negative mental health outcomes, gender-based violence, burdens of care and responsibility, attachment to land and traditions, and the importance of intersectionality. From these findings, there is a clear need for climate policies on adaptation and mitigation to reflect women's unique needs to ensure their health and safety.","['1 School of Health and Human Performance, Faculty of Health, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.

147,Mental health first aid for the UK Armed Forces,"Education programmes in mental health literacy can address stigma and misunderstanding of mental health. This study investigated self-rated differences in knowledge, attitudes and confidence around mental health issues following participation in a bespoke Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training course for the Armed Forces. The mixed methods approach comprised quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews. A survey, administered immediately post-training (n = 602) and again at 10-months post-attendance (n = 120), asked participants to rate their knowledge, attitudes and confidence around mental health issues pre- and post-training. Quantitative findings revealed a significant increase in knowledge, positive attitudes and confidence from the post-training survey which was sustained at 10-months follow-up.Semi-structured telephone interviews (n = 13) were conducted at follow-up, 6-months post-attendance. Qualitative findings revealed that participation facilitated an 'ambassador' type role for participants. This study is the first to have investigated the effect of MHFA in an Armed Forces community. Findings show participants perceived the training to increase knowledge regarding mental health and to enhance confidence and aptitude for identifying and supporting people with mental health problems. Results suggest that such an intervention can provide support for personnel, veterans and their families, regarding mental health in Armed Forces communities.","['1 School of Health and Social Care, University of Gloucestershire, Cheltenham, UK.', '2 Department of Sport Science, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, UK.', '3 Department for Health, University of Bath, Bath, UK.', '4 College of Engineering, Swansea University, UK.', '5 School of Health and Social Care, University of Gloucestershire, Gloucester, UK.', '6 School of Sport and Exercise, University of Gloucestershire, Gloucester, UK.']","Diane M Crone, Mustafa Sarkar, Thomas Curran, Colin M Baker, Denise Hill, Elizabeth A Loughren, Tabitha Dickson, Andrew Parker, ",Health promotion international,2020 Feb 1,Armed Forces; community-based intervention; mental health literacy; mixed methods.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30715280,NO TEXT (not hosted on top 3 sites)
148,"Precarious employment and general, mental and physical health in Stockholm, Sweden: a cross-sectional study","Objectives: To investigate the association between precarious employment and health in a sample of non-standard employees in Stockholm County, Sweden, by addressing three specific research questions: is the degree of precarious employment (low, moderate, high) associated with self-rated. . . (a) general health, (b) mental health, (c) musculoskeletal pain? Methods: Web-based respondent-driven sampling was used to recruit a sample of 415 employees in Stockholm, Sweden, during 2016-2017. Questionnaire data were collected on employment conditions (the Swedish version of the employment precariousness scale (EPRES-Se)), general health, mental health and musculoskeletal pain. EPRES-Se scores were categorised as low, moderate or high. Generalised linear models with Poisson distribution, log link functions and robust variances were applied for calculating crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (PR; aPR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all outcomes. Results: The prevalence ratios of poor self-rated general and mental health increased with increased degree of precariousness, as indicated by estimates of moderate precarious employment (a2PRModerate 1.44 (CI 0.98-2.11); a2PRModerate 1.13 (CI 0.82-1.62)), and high precarious employment (a2PRHigh 1.78 (CI 1.21-2.62); a2PRHigh 1.69 (CI 1.25-2.28)), albeit only significantly so for high precarious employment. Conclusions: This is the first study in Sweden reporting on the association between precarious employment, as measured with a multidimensional scale, and multiple health outcomes. The results add to the evidence of an association between precarious employment and self-rated poor general and mental health. Larger, representative studies with longitudinal designs using the EPRES-Se are called for in order to strengthen these results and the already existing evidence of the harm of precarious employment.","['1 Unit of Occupational Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Sweden.', '2 Centre for Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Stockholm County Council, Sweden.', '3 Centre for Epidemiology and Community Medicine, Stockholm County Council, Sweden.', '4 Equity and Health Policy Research Group, Karolinska Institutet, Sweden.', '5 Social Medicine and Global Health, Lund University, Sweden.', '6 Global and Sexual Health, Karolinska Institutet, Sweden.', '7 Section of Infectious Diseases, Uppsala University, Sweden.']","Johanna Jonsson, Nuria Matilla-Santander, Bertina Kreshpaj, Gun Johansson, Katarina Kjellberg, Bo Burström, Per-Olof Östergren, Karin Nilsson, Susanne Strömdahl, Cecilia Orellana, Theo Bodin, ",Scandinavian journal of public health,2021 Mar,Precarious employment; mental health; non-standard employment; occupational health; physical health.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32933426,PMC
149,Mental health literacy programs for school teachers: A systematic review and narrative synthesis,"Aim:
        
      
      The prevalence of mental disorders increases sharply during adolescence. Therefore, school teachers are in a good position to provide initial assistance to students with mental health problems. Although effects of a number of mental health literacy programs aimed at teachers have been reported, they have not yet been reviewed in a systematic manner. This study conducted a systematic review of the effectiveness of mental health literacy programs for teachers. Methods:
        
      
      PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, Web of Science and reference lists of included studies were searched in September 2018. Studies that quantitatively measured at least one of the main components of mental health literacy, including (a) knowledge of mental illnesses, (b) stigma towards mental illnesses, (c) confidence in helping students, and (d) behaviour of helping students, were included regardless of study design. Risk of bias was rated for each included study according to the Cochrane tool for randomized studies and the Cochrane tool, for raondomized studies, and the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomized Studies (RoBANS), for nonrandomized studies. Results:
        
      
      Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria, including 1 randomized controlled trial (RCT), 2 cluster RCTs, 1 controlled before-and-after study and 12 case series. Most of the studies claimed significant improvement of knowledge, attitudes, behaviour and/or confidence. However, the overall quality for all outcomes was relatively low; 15 studies had high/unclear risk of bias due to lack of allocation concealment, not controlling for confounders, and/or inadequate analysis for attrition. Conclusions:
        
      
      More high quality evidence is required before the effectiveness of mental health literacy programs for teachers can be established.","['1 Department of Physical and Health Education, Graduate School of Education, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', '2 Department of Genetic Epidemiology in Psychiatry, Central Institute of Mental Health, Medical Faculty Mannheim, University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.']","Satoshi Yamaguchi, Jerome C Foo, Asuka Nishida, Sayoko Ogawa, Fumiharu Togo, Tsukasa Sasaki, ",Early intervention in psychiatry,2020 Feb,adolescents; children; mental health literacy; program evaluation; school teachers.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30740884,wiley
