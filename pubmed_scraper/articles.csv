4,Dyadic coping and mental health in couples: A systematic review,"Globally, one out of three people suffer from a mental health issue during their lifetime. In romantic relationships, impaired mental health does not only affect the individual but also their partner and therefore needs to be coped with dyadically. In this systematic review, we summarize research examining dyadic coping (DC) in the context of mental health and individual and relational outcomes. We searched for peer-reviewed articles published between January 1990 and April 2023 on PsycInfo, Medline, and PSYNDEX on DC and mental health within romantic relationships. A total of 60 qualitative, quantitative, and intervention studies met the inclusion criteria, reporting on 16,394 individuals and 4,945 dyads. To synthesize the studies, we used a narrative synthesis approach. Overall, stress expression and positive DC yielded beneficial individual and relational outcomes, whereas, for negative DC, the opposite was true. Results differed between mental health clusters and context played an important role (e.g., symptom severity, life phase). Due to the great diversity of studies and variables, further research should focus on understudied mental health clusters (e.g., anxiety disorders). Clinicians are advised to view mental health issues as a dyadic rather than an individual phenomenon (""we-disease"") and develop tailored couple-centered interventions.","['1 Department of Psychology, University of Zurich, Switzerland.

11,Mental health triage tools: A narrative review,"Mental Health Triage (MHT) tools may be defined as any clinician administered scale that specifies psychiatric signs or symptoms, proposes a corresponding service response, and determines priority categories based on the level of perceived acuity. Multiple MHT tools are used across different jurisdictions and care settings. This article summarizes the literature on MHT tools, describes the available tools and the supportive evidence, evaluates the impact and clinical applications, and compares their strengths and weaknesses. This review utilized a systematic review process to identify articles examining MHT tools. Several benefits of using MHT tools are described; however, in general, the supportive evidence for their use is lacking. A modified Australasian Triage Scale has the strongest evidence base for use in emergency settings; however, further data are needed to establish improved outcomes. There is limited evidence for the use of MHT tools in ambulatory or primary care settings. No evidence was found supporting any one tool as effective in guiding service responses across the entire clinical spectrum. Future research could focus on developing and evaluating MHT tools that service all levels of illness presentation. Additionally, more robust studies are required to support the use of MHT tools in emergency settings. Finally, there is an impetus for the development and evaluation of MHT tools in ambulatory, community, and primary care settings.","['1 Barwon Health, Mental Health, Drugs and Alcohol Service, Geelong, Victoria, Australia.', '2 Monash Health, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.', '3 School of Medicine, Deakin University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']","Tayler Watson, Rachel Tindall, Amelia Patrick, Steven Moylan, ",International journal of mental health nursing,NO_DATE,mental health; mental health services; psychiatric nursing; psychiatry; triage.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36176247
12,Somatics and phenomenological psychopathology: a mental health proposal,"This work begins with a brief review - from the physical education movement that began in ancient Greece and is deeply rooted in 19th century Europe, to the somatics movement alive today. The review captures primary historical and conceptual references, relevant to the therapeutic-embodied exploratory work. Then, G. Stanghellini's mental health care model [2] is reviewed. This model is considered within reflexive self-awareness and spoken dialogue: the main vehicles in relation with alterity and its consequences in the realm of psychotherapeutic encounter and intervention. This will highlight the individual's bodily movement and inter-corporeal 'proto-dialogue' as a prior realm of therapeutic intervention. Next, a brief consideration of E. Strauss work [31] is presented. This paper's hypothesis is that bodily qualitative dynamics highlighted by phenomenology are essential for an effective mental health therapeutic intervention. A 'seed' of a framework is proposed in this paper; this seed assesses some phenomenological assets of a positive conception of mental health, for which self-awareness education is key to develop skills such as kinaesthetic intelligence and attunement and to educate healthy persons who can promote edifying social relations and environments.","['1 Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Doctoral School, Poznan, Poland. kmilosanchezs@gmail.com.']","Camilo SÃ¡nchez SÃ¡nchez, ",Theoretical medicine and bioethics,NO_DATE,Bodily Movement; Lived Time; Phenomenology; Psychopathology; Somatics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37231205

19,Contingent universality: The epistemic politics of global mental health,"The field of global mental health (GMH) has undergone profound changes over the past decade. Outgrowing its earlier agenda it has performed a reflexive turn, broadened towards a social paradigm and developed new modes of knowledge production, all of which reshaped 'mental health' as a global object of knowledge and care, and the epistemic politics of the field. Drawing on long-term ethnographic fieldwork among GMH experts and recent agenda-setting publications, I discuss how GMH advocates and critical observers alike have created conceptual and practical middle-grounds between different forms of mental health knowledge - across culture, epistemic power, lived experience, policy platforms and academic disciplines - framing their dynamic encounters as dialogue, adaptation, participation, co-production or integration. Ultimately, I argue, GMH today is focusing less on establishing mental health as a universal problem than on managing its inherent multiplicity through alignment and integration across different bodies of knowledge. Global knowledge, so conceived, is fluid and malleable and produced in open-ended knowledge practices, governed by what I call 'contingent universality'. It is not new that the concepts and practices of the psy-disciplines are malleable and multiple, internally and externally contested, rapidly changing over time and not easily transferrable across space. What is new is that within the increasingly heterogenous epistemic space of GMH, these features have become assets rather than liabilities. GMH knowledge achieves both global reach and local relevance precisely because 'mental health' can be many things; it can be expressed in a wide range of idioms and concepts, and its problems and solutions align easily with others, at many scales. These fluid and integrative knowledge practices call for renewed empirical, critical and collaborative engagement.","[""1 King's College London.""]","DÃ¶rte Bemme, ",Transcultural psychiatry,NO_DATE,contingent universality; decolonization; epistemic politics; global mental health.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37674438

23,Outside/inside: social determinants of mental health,"Individuals' mental health and wellbeing are dependent on many social factors including housing, employment, education and adequate nutrition among others. These factors can influence at personal, family and community levels. The interlinked and cumulative impact of these social determinants needs to be ascertained to aid appropriate patient management, as well as to establish prevention and health education programmes. Some of these determinants also have to be recognised at policy level. It is crucial for clinicians to understand the role social determinants play in the genesis and perpetuation of mental and physical illnesses, so that appropriate social interventions can be set in place. Clinicians have a role to play in their clinical practice, as well as advocates for their patients and policy leaders. In order to ensure that health is joined up with other sectors, such as education, employment, judiciary and housing, policy-makers must avoid silos. Every policy must have an impact assessment on physical health and mental health. Policy-makers need to understand scientific evidence and must work with researchers, clinicians, communities and patients to help develop and implement rights-based policies.","[""1 Academic Clinical Fellow, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."", '2 Academic Clinical Fellow, Centre for Academic Mental Health, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.', '3 Specialist Trainee, Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', ""4 Professor Emeritus Mental Health and Cultural Diversity, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.""]","Sam Nishanth Gnanapragasam, Laurence Astill Wright, Max Pemberton, Dinesh Bhugra, ",Irish journal of psychological medicine,NO_DATE,Social determinants; food poverty; health; malnutrition; mental health; poverty.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34193324
24,Mental health law: a comparison of compulsory hospital admission in Italy and the UK,"In Europe, the mental health law legal framework has had several changes throughout the years to achieve and develop new reforms, better mental health care, and protect the human rights of patients. The UK national data shows rising detention rates and the disproportionate use of the legal framework among people from black and minority ethnic groups. At the national level, compulsory admissions are lower in Italy; it also shows that it has increased in the last few years in both countries. The lack of ethnic national data, especially in Italy, limited the ability to understand compulsory admission, discrimination, and stigma in mental health.

      Conclusions: Attempts to cope with life challenges, frustration, fear, anxiety, stress should not be isolated endeavors, but they need to be placed in a wider philosophical context, as far as every issue, including mental health issues, has a philosophical perspective at its core. Such experience can cultivate human strength, self-confidence, awareness, empathy. In times of uncertainty, when we do not know where to go, when we do not understand who we are and what is our purpose on earth, philosophy helps us to find our way.

      There has been increasing concern about the burden of mental health problems among youth, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. Trends in mental health-related emergency department (ED) visits are an important indicator of unmet outpatient mental health needs. Objective:
        
      
      To estimate annual trends in mental health-related ED visits among US children, adolescents, and young adults between 2011 and 2020. Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      Data from 2011 to 2020 in the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, an annual cross-sectional national probability sample survey of EDs, was used to examine mental health-related visits for youths aged 6 to 24 years (unweighted = 49 515). Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      Mental health-related ED visits included visits associated with psychiatric or substance use disorders and were identified by International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM; 2011-2015) and ICD-10-CM (2016-2020) discharge diagnosis codes or by reason-for-visit (RFV) codes. We estimated the annual proportion of mental health-related pediatric ED visits from 2011 to 2020. Subgroup analyses were performed by demographics and broad psychiatric diagnoses. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analyses estimated factors independently associated with mental health-related ED visits controlling for period effects. Results:
        
      
      From 2011 to 2020, the weighted number of pediatric mental health-related visits increased from 4.8 million (7.7% of all pediatric ED visits) to 7.5 million (13.1% of all ED visits) with an average annual percent change of 8.0% (95% CI, 6.1%-10.1%; P < .001). Significant linearly increasing trends were seen among children, adolescents, and young adults, with the greatest increase among adolescents and across sex and race and ethnicity. While all types of mental health-related visits significantly increased, suicide-related visits demonstrated the greatest increase from 0.9% to 4.2% of all pediatric ED visits (average annual percent change, 23.1% [95% CI, 19.0%-27.5%]; P < .001). Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Over the last 10 years, the proportion of pediatric ED visits for mental health reasons has approximately doubled, including a 5-fold increase in suicide-related visits. These findings underscore an urgent need to improve crisis and emergency mental health service capacity for young people, especially for children experiencing suicidal symptoms.","['1 Department of Psychiatry and Psychology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', '2 Department of Psychiatry, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York.', '3 Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.', '4 New England Mental Illness, Research Education, and Clinical Center, VA Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, Connecticut.', '5 Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington.']","Tanner J Bommersbach, Alastair J McKean, Mark Olfson, Taeho Greg Rhee, ",JAMA,2023,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37129655

This Review outlines contributing neurodevelopmental and physical health conditions, rates and developmental trajectories of mental health challenges experienced by autistic people, as well as unique clinical presentations. A framework is proposed to consider four contributing themes to aid personalized formulation: social-contextual determinants, adverse life experiences, autistic cognitive features, and shared genetic and early environmental predispositions. Current evidence-based and clinical-knowledge-informed intervention guidance and ongoing development of support are highlighted for specific mental health areas. Tailored mental health support for autistic people should be neurodivergence-informed, which is fundamentally humanistic and compatible with the prevailing bio-psycho-social frameworks. The personalized formulation should be holistic, considering physical health and transdiagnostic neurodevelopmental factors, intellectual and communication abilities, and contextual-experiential determinants and their interplay with autistic cognition and biology, alongside resilience. Supporting family well-being is integral. Mutual empathic understanding is fundamental to creating societies in which people across neurotypes are all empowered to thrive.","['1 Margaret and Wallace McCain Centre for Child, Youth & Family Mental Health and Azrieli Adult Neurodevelopmental Centre, Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. mengchuan.lai@utoronto.ca.', '2 Department of Psychiatry, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. mengchuan.lai@utoronto.ca.', '3 Department of Psychology, Faculty of Arts and Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. mengchuan.lai@utoronto.ca.', '4 Department of Psychiatry, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. mengchuan.lai@utoronto.ca.', '5 Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. mengchuan.lai@utoronto.ca.', '6 Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan. mengchuan.lai@utoronto.ca.']","Meng-Chuan Lai, ",Nature human behaviour,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37864080

However, far less attention has been paid to mental health among elite coaches and high-performance support staff, the latter including strength and conditioning coaches, physiotherapists, sport psychologists, and other allied health workers in the daily training environment (high-performance support staff are referred to collectively as ""entourage"" throughout this article). The scarcity of research examining mental health among elite coaches and entourage warrants urgent attention, particularly given these individuals share similar performance demands and role-related stressors as elite athletes. This article reviews the available literature on this topic, including (1) an empirical study conducted by the authors with a sample of coaches and entourage from Australia's national high-performance sport system and (2) a case example to illustrate sport-specific and general risk factors that are likely to impact mental health in elite sporting environments.

37,Digitalising mental health care: Practical recommendations from the European Psychiatric Association,"The digitalisation of mental health care is expected to improve the accessibility and quality of specialised treatment services and introduce innovative methods to study, assess, and monitor mental health disorders. In this narrative review and practical recommendation of the European Psychiatric Association (EPA), we aim to help healthcare providers and policymakers to navigate this rapidly evolving field. We provide an overview of the current scientific and implementation status across two major domains of digitalisation: i) digital mental health interventions and ii) digital phenotyping, discuss the potential of each domain to improve the accessibility and outcomes of mental health services, and highlight current challenges faced by researchers, clinicians, and service users. Furthermore, we make several recommendations meant to foster the widespread adoption of evidence-based digital solutions for mental health care in the member states of the EPA. To realise the vision of a digitalised, patient-centred, and data-driven mental health ecosystem, a number of implementation challenges must be considered and addressed, spanning from human, technical, ethical-legal, and economic barriers. The list of priority areas and action points our expert panel has identified could serve as a playbook for this process.","['1 Institute of Psychiatric Phenomics and Genomics (IPPG), University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', '2 Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, LMU University Hospital, Munich, Germany.', '3 Department of Psychiatry, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', '4 MGZ - Medizinisch Genetisches Zentrum, Munich, Germany.', '5 Collaborative Antwerp Psychiatric Research Institute (CAPRI), University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.', '6 Department of Psychiatry, Bezmialem VakÄ±f University Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.', '7 North-Buda Saint John Central Hospital, Buda Family Centred Mental Health Centre, Department of Psychiatry and Psychiatric Rehabilitation, Teaching Department of Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', '8 National Advisory Unit on Concurrent Substance Abuse and Mental Health Disorders, Innlandet Hospital Trust, Hamar, Norway, Faculty of Social and Health Sciences, Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences, Elverum, Norway.', '9 Psychiatric University Clinic of CharitÃ© at St. Hedwig Hospital, Berlin, Germany.', '10 Mental Health Service, Parc TaulÃ­ University Hospital, Unitat Mixta de NeurociÃ¨ncia Traslacional I3PT-INc-UAB, Sabadell, Spain.', '11 Department of Psychiatry and Forensic Medicine, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Cerdanyola del VallÃ¨s, Spain.', '12 Centro de InvestigaciÃ³n BiomÃ©dica en Red de Salud Mental (CIBERSAM), Madrid, Spain.', '13 CNWL NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', '14 WHO Collaborating Centre DEU-131, VR-Klinikum DÃ¼sseldorf, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Heinrich-Heine-UniversitÃ¤t DÃ¼sseldorf, DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany.', '15 Unit of Clinical Psychiatry, Department of Clinical Neurosciences/DIMSC, School of Medicine, UniversitÃ  Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy.']","Janos L Kalman, Gerrit Burkhardt, Jerzy Samochowiec, Christian Gebhard, Geert Dom, Miriam John, Ozge Kilic, Tamas Kurimay, Lars Lien, Meryam Schouler-Ocak, Diego Palao Vidal, Jan Wiser, Wolfgang Gaebel, Umberto Volpe, Peter Falkai, ",European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists,2023,European Psychiatric Association; digital mental health; digital mental health interventions; digital phenotyping; telepsychiatry.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38086744

47,"The Geography of Mental Health, Urbanicity, and Affluence","Residential location has been shown to significantly impact mental health, with individuals in rural communities experiencing poorer mental health compared to those in urban areas. However, the influence of an individual's social group on the relationship between residential location and mental health outcomes remains unclear. This study disaggregates the rural-urban binary and investigates how geography and social groupings interact to shape mental health outcomes. Merging data from PLACES and Claritas PRIZM, we conducted a hotspot analysis, generated bivariate choropleth maps, and applied multiscale geographically weighted regressions to examine the spatial distribution of mental health and social groupings. Our findings reveal that mental health is influenced by complex interactions, with social groups playing a critical role. Our study highlights that not all rural and urban areas are alike, and the extent to which social groups influence mental health outcomes varies within and across these areas. These results underscore the need for policies that are tailored to meet the unique mental health needs of individuals from different social groups in specific geographic locations to inform policy interventions that more effectively address mental health disparities across diverse communities.","['1 Department of Political Science and Population Health, University of Houston, Houston, TX 77204, USA.']","Jeronimo Cortina, Shana Hardin, ",International journal of environmental research and public health,2023,geography; geospatial statistics; mental health; social groups.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37107722

49,Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Mental Health and Mental Health Care During The COVID-19 Pandemic,"During the pandemic, the overall mental health of the US population declined. Given higher rates of COVID-19 infections and deaths experienced by communities of color along with greater exposure to pandemic-related stressors (e.g., unemployment, food insecurity), we expect that the decline in mental health during the pandemic was more pronounced among Black, Hispanic, and Asian adults, with these groups also having less access to mental health services. We examine two nationally representative US surveys: the 2019 National Household Interview Survey (NHIS; N = 30,368) and the 2020-2021 Household Pulse Survey (HPS; N = 1,677,238). We find mental health of Black, Hispanic, and Asian respondents worsened relative to White respondents during the pandemic, with significant increases in depression and anxiety among racialized minorities compared to Whites. There is also evidence of especially high mental health burden for Black adults around the murder of George Floyd by police and for Asian adults around the murder of six Asian women in Atlanta. White respondents are most likely to receive professional mental health care before and during the pandemic, and Black, Hispanic, and Asian respondents demonstrate higher levels of unmet mental health care needs during the pandemic than White respondents. Our results indicate that within the current environment, White adults are at a large and systemic advantage buffering them from unexpected crises-like the COVID-19 pandemic. Without targeted interventions, the long-term social consequences of the pandemic and other co-occurring events (e.g., death of Black and Hispanic people by police) will likely include widening mental health disparities between racial/ethnic groups.","['1 Department of Sociology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Heritage Hall 460, 1401 University Blvd., Birmingham, AL, 35233, USA. mthomeer@uab.edu.', '2 Department of Sociology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Heritage Hall 460, 1401 University Blvd., Birmingham, AL, 35233, USA.', '3 Department of Sociology, Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, OH, USA.']","Mieke Beth Thomeer, Myles D Moody, Jenjira Yahirun, ",Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities,NO_DATE,Racism; Race/ethnicity; Mental health; COVID-19 pandemic; Mental health care; Health disparities.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35318615

      To critically analyse theories of friendship through privileging research on the experience of friendship among those who have experienced mental ill-health. To inform public health approaches that aim to facilitate friendship and assist those experiencing mental ill-health. Method:
        
      
      A selective, iterative, purposive review of theoretical and empirical studies, within a critical realist epistemology, is undertaken to provide an analysis. Results:

63,Reframing Mental Health Ethics,"Mental health ethics has been classically focused on ethical concepts and problems in clinical mental health spaces. Psychiatric and psychotherapeutic ethics are main threads of analysis in this subfield of bioethics. However, ethical issues emerge around mental health and illness both within and beyond clinical settings. In particular, ethical quandaries arise in employment, education, family caregiving, and incarceration of people with mental health conditions outside of the clinical setting. Likewise, ethics are an important consideration within alternative care systems where mentally ill people seek support beyond biomedicine, psychotherapy, and case management. In this article, we argue that our understanding of ""mental health ethics"" should expand to be more inclusive of value questions and conflicts that arise in all areas of the lives of people with mental health conditions, rather than focusing more narrowly on how clinical practitioners and researchers should best respond to ethical quandaries in the delivery of mental healthcare. Community mental health is an ideal space in which to think about such ethical issues, as scholars and practitioners in the field strive to meet not only medical needs but the broader social needs of people with mental health conditions. We begin by providing an overview of psychiatric and psychotherapeutic ethics, and then describe broader applications of ethics in the lives of people experiencing mental illness. We encourage community mental health practitioners and researchers to reconceptualize disciplinary boundaries to consider the vast scope of ethical issues related to mental health in and out of the clinic.","['1 Department of Bioethics, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, 10900 Euclid Avenue, Sears Tower TA200, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA. julia.knopes@case.edu.', '2 Cleveland Clinic Center for Bioethics, Cleveland, USA.']","Julia Knopes, Laura Guidry-Grimes, ",Community mental health journal,NO_DATE,Bioethics; Lived experience; Mental health ethics; Psychiatric ethics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37787887

65,Reimagining global mental health in Africa,"In 2001, the WHO launched The World Health Report most specifically addressing low-income and middle-income countries (LAMICs). It highlighted the importance of mental health (MH), identifying the severe public health impacts of mental ill health and made 10 recommendations. In 2022, the WHO launched another world MH report and reaffirmed the 10 recommendations, while concluding that 'business as usual for MH will simply not do' without higher infusions of money. This paper suggests the reason for so little change over the last 20 years is due to the importation and imposition of Western MH models and frameworks of training, service development and research on the assumption they are relevant and acceptable to Africans in LAMICs. This ignores the fact that most mental and physical primary care occurs within local non-Western traditions of healthcare that are dismissed and assumed irrelevant by Western frameworks. These trusted local institutions of healthcare that operate in homes and spiritual spaces are in tune with the lives and culture of local people. We propose that Western foundations of MH knowledge are not universal nor are their assumptions of society globally applicable. Real change in the MH of LAMICs requires reimagining. Local idioms of distress and healing, and explanatory models of suffering within particular populations, are needed to guide the development of training curricula, research and services. An integration of Western frameworks into these more successful approaches are more likely to contribute to the betterment of MH for peoples in LAMICs.","['1 College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.', '2 Department of Psychiatry, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', '3 The Wilson Centre, University Health Network and Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', '4 The Wilson Centre, University Health Network and Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada cynthia.whitehead@utoronto.ca.', '5 Department of Family and Community Medicine, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', ""6 Women's College Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.""]","Dawit Wondimagegn, Clare Pain, Nardos Seifu, Carrie Cartmill, Azeb Asaminew Alemu, Cynthia Ruth Whitehead, ",BMJ global health,NO_DATE,Health policy; Health services research; Health systems; Mental Health & Psychiatry.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37666576

71,Effectiveness of mental health interventions for older adults in South Asia: A scoping review,"Objective:
        
      
      Mental health problems among older adults are becoming a growing public health concern in South Asia due to continued changes in population dynamics caused by declining fertility rates and increasing life expectancy. This scoping review aimed to explore and summarize evidence about mental health interventions and their impacts on geriatric mental health and highlight gaps and areas for future research. Methods:
        
      
      We searched six electronic databases and additional sources for experimental/non-experimental studies evaluating the effectiveness of geriatric mental health interventions in eight countries in the South Asia region from the date of inception of each database up to August 5, 2022. Following the preliminary screening, we extracted data from the eligible articles using a Microsoft Excel data extraction worksheet. We followed Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines for this scoping review and reported evidence adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist. Results:
        
      
      From a total of 3432 potential articles retrieved, 19 were included in this review following pre-determined eligibility criteria. Across studies, mental health interventions can be broadly categorized into the following types- 1) traditional Yoga, Tai chi, or other meditative movements; 2) behavioral, occupational, or learning-based interventions; 3) tech-based interventions; 4) music therapy; and 5) new healthcare model. The evidence was predominantly based on India (n = 16), whereas three articles were identified from Pakistan. No article was found from six other South Asian countries. Depression and anxiety were the most frequent mental health outcomes, followed by quality of life, cognitive function, self-esteem, physical performance, and many more. Conclusion:
        
      
      Although limited, this review found various interventions that have varying effects on different geriatric mental health outcomes. A handful of evidence on mental health intervention in South Asia indicates a lack of acknowledgment that may develop a serious paucity of geriatric mental health practice. Therefore, future researchers are encouraged to conduct empirical studies to understand disease burden, including associated factors of geriatric mental health, which may help to construct contextually appropriate mental health interventions in this region.","['1 Division of Global Health, Research Initiative for Health Equity (RiHE), Khulna, Bangladesh.', '2 Response Plan, United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) Bangladesh, Ukhiya, Bangladesh.', '3 Institute of Nutrition and Food Sciences, University of Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh.', '4 Department of Biochemistry, Armed Forces Medical College, Dhaka, Bangladesh.', '5 Department of Public Health, North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh.', '6 Division of Nutrition and Clinical Service, International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b), Dhaka, Bangladesh.']","Hoimonty Mazumder, Farah Faizah, Easter Protiva Gain, Irfath Sharmin Eva, Kaniz Ferdouse Mou, Nobonita Saha, Farzana Rahman, Jyoti Das, A M Khairul Islam, Fazilatun Nesa, M Mahbub Hossain, ",PloS one,2023,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37418368
72,Urban precarity and youth mental health: An interpretive scoping review of emerging approaches,"Circumstances of living are key to shaping emotional and affective experiences, long term health, wellbeing and opportunities. In an era characterised by rapid urbanisation across the majority of the world, there is increasing interest in the interaction between mental health and urban environments, but insufficient attention is paid to how mental health is situated in space and time. Socio-economic inequalities are prevalent in many urban environments globally, making conditions of living highly precarious for some social groups including young people. There remains a large volume of unmet mental health service needs, and young people are impacted by uncertain economic futures. The purpose of this scoping review is to develop an interdisciplinary and globally-informed understanding of the urban conditions which affect youth mental health across a range of scales, and to identify protective factors which can promote better youth mental health. We seek to broaden the scope of urban mental health research beyond the physical features of urban environments to develop an interpretive framework based on perspectives shared by young people. We illustrate how concepts from social theory can be used as an integrative framework to emphasise both young people's lived experiences and the wider cultural and political dynamics of urban mental health.","['1 School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, Institute for Mental Health and Centre for Urban Wellbeing, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.

73,Global mental health and its social determinants: How should we intervene?,"This paper makes the case for expanding the field of global mental health to give more attention to the social determinants of mental health. It does so by describing challenges and opportunities for intervening to address these social determinants, and by presenting some potential approaches to the choice, design and evaluation of such interventions, especially in low and middle-income countries. Challenges include distal interventions, limits to the modifiability of some social and economic determinants, poorly understood mechanisms, difficulty defining the boundaries of such interventions, the need for inter-disciplinary and inter-sectoral collaboration, limited datasets in LMIC, sample size challenges for prevention interventions, ethical issues and siloed research funding. Potential approaches include the development of more robust causal models, trial designs that allow for analysis of mechanisms and the pooling of data across diverse settings to explore the role of contextual variables. Several criteria can inform the selection of interventions that target social determinants and these include the need for plausible mechanisms, feasibility, acceptability, cultural validity of moderator, mediator and outcome variables, generalizability and sustainability. These approaches require a high level of inter-sectoral and inter-disciplinary cooperation and data sharing across sites internationally. Examples are provided from ongoing research in LMIC.","[""1 Centre for Global Mental Health, Health Service and Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, United Kingdom; Alan J Flisher Centre for Public Mental Health, Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.

75,Opening up mental health research,"Open science provides a compelling framework for accelerating global collaborations and enabling discoveries to understand and treat mental health disorders. Herein, we discuss the advantages and obstacles to adopting open science in mental health research, considering the particularities of sensitive and diverse data types, the potential of co-designing projects with research participants and the opportunity of amplifying open science by integration with mental health care. We present a practical example of how this landscape may be navigated to adopt open science across an entire research centre, in 5 steps, namely leadership committing to open science; finding models, resources and allies; identifying needs; defining open science principles; and putting principles into practice. We derive lessons learned that can be built upon by researchers and research organizations joining the open science movement in mental health.","['1 From the Douglas Research Centre, MontrÃ©al, Que.

76,Geopsychiatry and geography: A response,"Background:
        
      
      This contribution responds to three articles (we refer to all three as 'editorials') concerning something called 'geopsychiatry'. Aims:
        
      
      To evaluate claims made in these editorials for 'geopsychiatry' as a new field of inquiry at the interface between geography and psychiatry. Method:
        
      
      Close critical reading of two editorials in the International Journal of Social Psychiatry - entitled 'Geographical determinants of mental health' and 'Political determinants of mental health' - and one in the International Review of Psychiatry - entitled 'What is geopsychiatry?' Results:
        
      
      While this geopsychiatry initiative is to be applauded, disquiet can be expressed about the almost complete neglect of a pre-existing domain of inquiry - 'mental health geography' or 'the geography of mental health' - that has long been researched by academic geographers and cognate scholars. Key trajectories in this field can be identified and related to the proposed foci for geopsychiatry. Conclusions:
        
      
      The hope is voiced that future developments in geopsychiatry will proceed in dialogue with the literature and practitioners of mental health geography.","['1 School of Geographical and Earth Sciences, University of Glasgow, Scotland, UK.']","Chris Philo, Felicity Callard, Cheryl McGeachan, Hester Parr, ",The International journal of social psychiatry,NO_DATE,Mental health geography; geography of mental health; geopolitics; geopsychiatry; interdisciplinarity.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37843025
77,De-medicalising public mental health with the Power Threat Meaning Framework,"Aims:
        
      
      To propose that the language and concepts in public mental health are often medicalised and to suggest that the power threat meaning framework (PTMF), can be a useful resource for those wishing to take a de-medicalising approach. Method:
        
      
      Examples of medicalisation from the literature and from practice are discussed and key constructs in the PTMF are explained, drawing from the report which presented its research base. Results:
        
      
      Examples of medicalisation in public mental health include: the uncritical use of psychiatric diagnostic categories; the 'illness like any other' approach in anti-stigma campaigns; and the implicit privileging of biology in the biopsychosocial model. The negative operations of power in society are seen as posing threats to human needs and people make sense of such situations in varied ways, though there are some commonalities. This gives rise to culturally available and bodily enabled threat responses which serve a variety of functions. From a medicalised perspective, these responses to threat are characteristically seen as 'symptoms' of underlying disorders. The PTMF is both a conceptual framework and a practical tool that can be used by individuals, groups and communities. Conclusion:
        
      
      Consistent with social epidemiological research, prevention efforts should focus on preventing adversity rather than 'disorders' but the added value of the PTMF is that varied problems can be understood in an integrated manner as responses to a variety of threats whose functions could be met in different ways. Its message that mental distress is often a response to adversity is comprehensible to the public and can be communicated in an accessible way.","['1 Mental Health & Social Change Research Group, School of Psychology, University of East London, London E15 4LZ, UK.']","D J Harper, ",Perspectives in public health,NO_DATE,mental health; psychology; public health.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37132024

83,"Universal, selective and indicated interventions for supporting mental health at the workplace: an umbrella review of meta-analyses","The current umbrella review aimed to assess and summarise evidence on universal, selective and indicated interventions for mental health at the workplace. This umbrella review forms one of the evidence reviews which were commissioned by the WHO to develop global guidelines on mental health at work. We conducted systematic searches in five bibliographic databases (PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane and Global Medicus Index) and included meta-analyses of randomised trials examining psychosocial, physical activity and lifestyle interventions delivered to all general workers (universal interventions), at-risk workers (selective interventions) and workers already experiencing symptoms of mental disorders (indicated interventions). We included outcomes from seven domains: symptoms of mental health conditions, positive mental health, quality of life, work-related outcomes, substance use, suicide-related outcomes and potential adverse effects. We identified 16 meta-analyses producing 66 pooled effect sizes of the examined interventions, mostly on symptoms of mental health conditions (n=43 pooled effect sizes) (eg, burnout, insomnia, stress) and positive mental health (n=15) (eg, well-being). Most of the evidence on universal, selective and indicated interventions was focused on psychosocial interventions, showing small to moderate effects across the various outcomes. Certainty levels according to GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) were low to very low in almost all of the examined outcomes. The results of existing meta-analyses are promising for the use of preventative and early treatment interventions in the workplace. However, the quality and certainty of the evidence were very modest, and further research on the effectiveness of these interventions is warranted.","['1 Department of Clinical, Neuro and Developmental Psychology, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands clara.miguelsanz@vu.nl.', '2 Department of Clinical, Neuro and Developmental Psychology, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', '3 School of Psychology, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', '4 Division of Insurance Medicine, Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', '5 Department of Mental Health and Substance Use, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland.', '6 Society and Health, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.', '7 Department of Neuroscience, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', '8 WHO Collaborating Centre for Research and Dissemination of Psychological Interventions, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']","Clara Miguel, Arpana Amarnath, Aemal Akhtar, Aiysha Malik, GergÅ Baranyi, Corrado Barbui, Eirini Karyotaki, Pim Cuijpers, ",Occupational and environmental medicine,NO_DATE,mental health; meta-analysis; occupational health.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36828633

86,Heatwave and mental health,"Physical health has been associated with ambient temperature and heatwave. With the frequent occurrence of heatwave, the adaptive effects and mechanisms on mental health remain uncertain. On the basis of the China Health and Nutrition Survey, we estimated the relationship between heatwaves and self-assessed mental health scores in the Chinese population aged 50 and above. This study has identified that with each additional heatwave event, mental health scores decreased by an average of 0.027 points, which is equivalent to 0.3% of the average level. Heat is more likely to affect groups with low education, no medical insurance, and living in rural areas. In mechanistic exploration, we found that stress emotion is a fully mediating effect. Heat led to reduced health activities and more frequent drinking, which may lead to lower psychological well-being. Moreover, good dietary preference is a regulator that can help mitigate the adverse effects of heat on mental health. This study corroborates the impact of heat on spiritual welfare, and demonstrates the mechanisms and channels of impact, which can help reduce global economic losses due to mental health problems.","['1 School of Economics, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.

88,Mental health and disability research in Ghana: a rapid review,"The objective of this rapid review was to explore the current evidence base for mental health and disability research in Ghana. The PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist was followed. Online databases were used to identify primary studies, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, rapid reviews, or guidelines published between 2010 and 2020. All relevant published (both peer-reviewed articles and grey literature) on mental health and/or disability research conducted in or on Ghana between 2010 and 2020 were included in this review. 4,791 articles were identified in the initial search. After the removal of duplicates, followed by title and abstract screening, 930 articles were selected for full-text review. An additional 8 articles identified from reference lists of included articles were also included in full-text review. After review, 375 articles were selected for inclusion; 234 (62%) were on mental health while the remaining 141 (38%) were on disability. There is an increasing trend in the absolute number of mental health and/or disability studies. Most of the mental health studies included in this review were either observational quantitative studies (n=132; 56%) or observational qualitative studies (n=79; 34%). There were very few interventional studies (n=6; 3%). A similar finding was noted for the disability studies. External funding accounted for 51% of mental health articles. Although there was a steady year-on-year increase in the absolute number of mental health and/or disability studies conducted between 2010 to 2020, there is a need for more intervention studies to evaluate what mental health and/or disability interventions work, for whom, and under what circumstances. These should include evaluations of the cost, benefits, effectiveness, and acceptability of various interventions for policy and planning. Further, there is a need for the Ministry of Health to prioritize research funding for mental health and disability and enhance technical and methodological capacity of researchers to conduct disability and mental health research in Ghana.","['1 Tropical Health, London, United Kingdom.', '2 Ghana Somubi Dwumadie (Ghana Participation Programme), East Legon, Accra, Ghana.', '3 Kintampo Health Research Centre, Research and Development Division, Ghana Health Service, Kintampo North Municipality, Bono East Region, Ghana.', ""4 Centre for Global Mental Health, Health Service and Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's Global Health Institute, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", '5 Alan J Flisher Centre for Public Mental Health, Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.', '6 Department of Social and Behavioural Sciences, College of Health Sciences, University of Ghana, Accra, Ghana.']","Grace Mwangi, Lionel Sakyi, Kenneth Ayuurebobi Ae-Ngibise, Crick Lund, Benedict Weobong, ",The Pan African medical journal,2023,Ghana; Mental health; disability.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37900204
89,The Use of Mental Health Simulation in Pharmacy Practice and Education: A Systematic Review,"Objectives:
        
      
      To explore how mental health simulation has been used in the context of pharmacy practice and education, specifically what types of simulation techniques have been used, and which mental health-related content has been simulated. Findings:
        
      
      A literature search retrieved 449 reports, from which 26 articles pertaining to 23 studies were eligible for inclusion. Most studies were conducted in Australia. The most common type of simulation utilized was live simulated/standardized patient, followed by pre-recorded scenarios, role-play, and auditory simulation. While many study interventions included content relating to multiple mental illnesses and included activities other than simulation, the most simulated mental health content was enacting a person living with depression (with or without suicidal thoughts), mental health communication, followed by stress-induced insomnia, then hallucinations. Key outcomes from included studies were significantly improved student outcomes such as mental health knowledge, attitudes, social distance, and empathy scores, as well as highlighting the potential to further improve the mental healthcare skills of community pharmacists. Summary:
        
      
      This review demonstrates a varied use of techniques to simulate mental health in pharmacy practice and education. Future research is suggested to consider other simulation methods such as virtual reality and computer simulation, and to investigate how lesser-simulated mental health content such as psychosis could be incorporated. It is also recommended that future research provides greater detail on the development of the simulated content, such as involving people with lived experience of mental illness and mental health stakeholders in the development process to improve the authenticity of simulation training.","['1 The University of Sydney School of Pharmacy, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.
