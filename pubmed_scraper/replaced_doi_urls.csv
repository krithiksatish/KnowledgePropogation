0,Mental health: The burden of social stigma,"The burden of mental health has two facets, social and psychological. Social stigma causes individuals who suspect to be suffering from a mental condition to conceal it, importantly by seeking care from a nonspecialist provider willing to diagnose it as physical disease. In this way, social stigma adds to both the direct and indirect cost of mental health. A microeconomic model depicting an individual who searches for an accommodating provider leads to the prediction that individuals undertake more search in response to a higher degree of social stigma. However, this holds only in the absence of errors in decision-making, typically as long as mental impairment is not too serious. While government and employers have an incentive to reduce the burden of social stigma, their efforts therefore need to focus on persons with a degree of mental impairment that still allows them to avoid errors in pursuing their own interest.","['1 Department of Economics, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.']","Peter Zweifel, ",The International journal of health planning and management,2021 May,concealment; mental health; nondisclosure; search; social stigma.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33591577,{'onlinelibrary.wiley.com': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hpm.3122'}
1,"Population-Based Approaches to Mental Health: History, Strategies, and Evidence","There is growing recognition in the fields of public health and mental health services research that the provision of clinical services to individuals is not a viable approach to meeting the mental health needs of a population. Despite enthusiasm for the notion of population-based approaches to mental health, concrete guidance about what such approaches entail is lacking, and evidence of their effectiveness has not been integrated. Drawing from research and scholarship across multiple disciplines, this review provides a concrete definition of population-based approaches to mental health, situates these approaches within their historical context in the United States, and summarizes the nature of these approaches and their evidence. These approaches span three domains: (a) social, economic, and environmental policy interventions that can be implemented by legislators and public agency directors, (b) public health practice interventions that can be implemented by public health department officials, and (c) health care system interventions that can be implemented by hospital and health care system leaders.","['1 Department of Health Management and Policy, Dornsife School of Public Health, Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA; email: jpp46@drexel.edu.', '2 Mental Health America, Alexandria, Virginia 22314, USA.', '3 Department of Community Health and Prevention, Dornsife School of Public Health, Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.']","Jonathan Purtle, Katherine L Nelson, Nathaniel Z Counts, Michael Yudell, ",Annual review of public health,2020 Apr 2,health care system design; mental health; population health; psychiatric epidemiology; public health practice; public policy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31905323,"{'www.annualreviews.org': 'https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-040119-094247?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub  0pubmed', 'www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/31905323/'}"
2,Cost-effectiveness evidence of mental health prevention and promotion interventions: A systematic review of economic evaluations,"Background:
        
      
      The prevention of mental disorders and promotion of mental health and well-being are growing fields. Whether mental health promotion and prevention interventions provide value for money in children, adolescents, adults, and older adults is unclear. The aim of the current study is to update 2 existing reviews of cost-effectiveness studies in this field in order to determine whether such interventions are cost-effective. Methods and findings:
        
      
      Electronic databases (including MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and EconLit through EBSCO and Embase) were searched for published cost-effectiveness studies of prevention of mental disorders and promotion of mental health and well-being from 2008 to 2020. The quality of studies was assessed using the Quality of Health Economic Studies Instrument (QHES). The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (# CRD42019127778). The primary outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) or return on investment (ROI) ratio across all studies. A total of 65 studies met the inclusion criteria of a full economic evaluation, of which, 23 targeted children and adolescents, 35 targeted adults, while the remaining targeted older adults. A large number of studies focused on prevention of depression and/or anxiety disorders, followed by promotion of mental health and well-being and other mental disorders. Although there was high heterogeneity in terms of the design among included economic evaluations, most studies consistently found that interventions for mental health prevention and promotion were cost-effective or cost saving. The review found that targeted prevention was likely to be cost-effective compared to universal prevention. Screening plus psychological interventions (e.g., cognitive behavioural therapy [CBT]) at school were the most cost-effective interventions for prevention of mental disorders in children and adolescents, while parenting interventions and workplace interventions had good evidence in mental health promotion. There is inconclusive evidence for preventive interventions for mental disorders or mental health promotion in older adults. While studies were of general high quality, there was limited evidence available from low- and middle-income countries. The review was limited to studies where mental health was the primary outcome and may have missed general health promoting strategies that could also prevent mental disorder or promote mental health. Some ROI studies might not be included given that these studies are commonly published in grey literature rather than in the academic literature. Conclusions:
        
      
      Our review found a significant growth of economic evaluations in prevention of mental disorders or promotion of mental health and well-being over the last 10 years. Although several interventions for mental health prevention and promotion provide good value for money, the varied quality as well as methodologies used in economic evaluations limit the generalisability of conclusions about cost-effectiveness. However, the finding that the majority of studies especially in children, adolescents, and adults demonstrated good value for money is promising. Research on cost-effectiveness in low-middle income settings is required. Trial registration:

3,What is good mental health? A scoping review,"Promotion of good mental health in young people with and without mental disorders has received little empirical research attention and interventions for improving mental health in young people are not well established. This situation could be explained among other reasons due to the difficulties to define and operationalise what good mental health is. The current manuscript, produced by the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology Thematic Working Group on the Prevention of Mental Disorders and Mental Health Promotion (ECNP TWG PMD-MHP), presents a critical review of the available operationalizations for good mental health. A pragmatic conceptual operationalisation of good mental health is a much-needed step towards more standardised research in this field. Good mental health can be defined as a state of well-being that allows individuals to cope with the normal stresses of life and function productively. Universal and selective interventions are suitable to promote mental health. Core domains that define good mental health encompass: (i) mental health literacy, (ii) attitude towards mental disorders, (iii) self-perceptions and values, (iv) cognitive skills, (v) academic/ occupational performance, (vi) emotions, (vii) behaviours, (viii) self-management strategies, (ix) social skills, (x) family and significant relationships (xi) physical health, (xii) sexual health, (xiii) meaning of life, (xiv) and quality of life. These domains should be widely traceable in the literature and can be used to conduct further empirical research in the field of good mental health. Such data can lead to more robust evidence to identify and establish the pathways to follow in order to improve mental health.","[""1 Early Psychosis: Interventions and Clinical-detection (EPIC) lab, Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK; OASIS service, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK; Department of Brain and Behavioural Sciences, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy; National Institute for Health Research, Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.

4,Public Mental Health in Post-COVID-19 Era,"Transmission of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has now rapidly spread around the world, which has alarming implications for individuals and communities, in particular for public mental health. Significant progress has been made in the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, but the psychological crisis caused by the epidemic is still not over and may continue to exist. The public mental health in the post-COVID-19 era should not be ignored. This article provides early warning for the public's mental health in the post-COVID-19 era by listing the characteristics and duration of the public mental health crisis following the SARS outbreak. In addition, based on the current situation, specific methods and measures are proposed in order to provide effective reference for the prevention and control of psychological crisis caused by the COVID-19 epidemic.","['1 Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.']","Fei-Fei Ren, Rong-Juan Guo, ",Psychiatria Danubina,2020 Summer,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32796794,{'www.psychiatria-danubina.com': 'http://www.psychiatria-danubina.com/UserDocsImages/pdf/dnb_vol32_no2/dnb_vol32_no2_251.pdf'}
5,"Swimming training improves mental health parameters, cognition and motor coordination in children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder","The aim of this study was to verify the effects of swimming-learning program of mental health parameters, cognition and motor coordination in students with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Thirty-three children of both sexes between 11 and 14 years were randomized into trained group (n = 18) and untrained group (n = 15). The training was performed for 8 weeks. Then, before and after 48 h of training period of both groups were submitted to find the mental health, cognition, motor coordination test, and physical fitness. Our results demonstrate that the aquatic exercise program significantly improved the depression parameters (p = 0.048), stress (p = 0.039), cognitive flexibility (p = 0.042) and selective attention (p = 0.047). In relation to motor coordination and physical fitness, the results showed significant improvements in the coordination of lower limbs laterality (p = 0.05), flexibility (p = 0.049), and abdominal resistance (p = 0.037). Taken together, the results suggest that swimming-learning program significantly improved the mental health, cognition, and motor coordination in children with ADHD.","['1 Laboratory of Exercise Psychophysiology, Advanced Aquatic Exercise Research Group, Universidade do Extremo Sul Catarinense , Criciúma, Brazil.', '2 Laboratory of Molecular Iron Metabolism, College of Life Science, Hebei Normal University , Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.', '3 Laboratory of Exercise Biochemistry in Health, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, School of Medicine, Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Paraná , Curitiba, Brazil.', '4 Laboratory of Experimental Physiopathology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Universidade do Extremo Sul Catarinense , Criciúma, Brazil.']","Luciano Acordi Da Silva, Ramiro Doyenart, Paulo Henrique Salvan, Welber Rodrigues, João Felipe Lopes, Karen Gomes, Anand Thirupathi, Ricardo Aurino De Pinho, Paulo Cesar Silveira, ",International journal of environmental health research,2020 Oct,ADHD; cognitive flexibility; physical exercise; selective attention; swimming.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31081373,{'www.tandfonline.com': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09603123.2019.1612041'}
6,Connected Mental Health: Systematic Mapping Study,"Background:
        
      
      Although mental health issues constitute an increasing global burden affecting a large number of people, the mental health care industry is still facing several care delivery barriers such as stigma, education, and cost. Connected mental health (CMH), which refers to the use of information and communication technologies in mental health care, can assist in overcoming these barriers. Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this systematic mapping study is to provide an overview and a structured understanding of CMH literature available in the Scopus database. Methods:
        
      
      A total of 289 selected publications were analyzed based on 8 classification criteria: publication year, publication source, research type, contribution type, empirical type, mental health issues, targeted cohort groups, and countries where the empirically evaluated studies were conducted. Results:
        
      
      The results showed that there was an increasing interest in CMH publications; journals were the main publication channels of the selected papers; exploratory research was the dominant research type; advantages and challenges of the use of technology for mental health care were the most investigated subjects; most of the selected studies had not been evaluated empirically; depression and anxiety were the most addressed mental disorders; young people were the most targeted cohort groups in the selected publications; and Australia, followed by the United States, was the country where most empirically evaluated studies were conducted. Conclusions:
        
      
      CMH is a promising research field to present novel approaches to assist in the management, treatment, and diagnosis of mental health issues that can help overcome existing mental health care delivery barriers. Future research should be shifted toward providing evidence-based studies to examine the effectiveness of CMH solutions and identify related issues.","['1 Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates.', '2 National School For Computer Science, Mohammed V University in Rabat, Rabat, Morocco.', '3 Salumedia Labs, Seville, Spain.', '4 Adhera Health Inc, Palo Alto, CA, United States.', '5 TICLab, International University of Rabat, Rabat, Morocco.']","Nidal Drissi, Sofia Ouhbi, Mohammed Abdou Janati Idrissi, Luis Fernandez-Luque, Mounir Ghogho, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2020 Aug 28,connected health; eHealth; health informatics; information systems; information technology; interdisciplinary research; mHealth; mental health; mobile health; mobile phone; review; telehealth.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32857055,"{'www.jmir.org': 'https://www.jmir.org/2020/8/e19950/', 'www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/32857055/'}"
7,The mental health impacts of receiving a breast cancer diagnosis: A meta-analysis,"Background:
        
      
      Receiving a breast cancer diagnosis can be a turning point with negative impacts on mental health, treatment and prognosis. This meta-analysis sought to determine the nature and prevalence of clinically significant psychological distress-related symptoms in the wake of a breast cancer diagnosis. Methods:
        
      
      Ten databases were searched between March and August 2020. Thirty-nine quantitative studies were meta-analysed. Results:
        
      
      The prevalence of clinically significant symptoms was 39% for non-specific distress (n = 13), 34% for anxiety (n = 19), 31% for post-traumatic stress (n = 7) and 20% for depression (n = 25). No studies reporting breast cancer patients' well-being in our specific time frame were found. Conclusion:
        
      
      Mental health can be impacted in at least four domains following a diagnosis of breast cancer and such effects are commonplace. This study outlines a clear need for mitigating the impacts on mental health brought about by breast cancer diagnosis.

Children and adolescents were also greatly impacted by the abrupt withdrawal from school, social life and outdoor activities. Some of them also experienced domestic violence growing. The stress they are subjected to directly impacts their mental health on account of increased anxiety, changes in their diets and in school dynamics, fear or even failing to scale the problem. Our aim is to bring up a discussion under different aspects and to alert public health and government agents about the need for surveillance and care of these individuals. We hope that the damage to their mental health as a result of the side effect of this pandemic can be mitigated by adequate and timely intervention.","['1 Department of Neurobiology and Program of Neurosciences, Institute of Biology, Federal Fluminense University, Niterói, 24020-141, Brazil.', '2 NuPEDEN, Nucleus for Research, Education, Dissemination and Neurosciences Popularization, Department of Neurobiology and Program of Neurosciences, Institute of Biology, Federal Fluminense University, Niterói 24020-141, Brazil; Thymus Research Laboratory, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-360, Brazil.', '3 NuPEDEN, Nucleus for Research, Education, Dissemination and Neurosciences Popularization, Department of Neurobiology and Program of Neurosciences, Institute of Biology, Federal Fluminense University, Niterói 24020-141, Brazil; Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Laboratory of Neurophysiology of Behavior, Biomedical Institute, Federal Fluminense University, Brazil.', '4 NuPEDEN, Nucleus for Research, Education, Dissemination and Neurosciences Popularization, Department of Neurobiology and Program of Neurosciences, Institute of Biology, Federal Fluminense University, Niterói 24020-141, Brazil.', '5 NuPEDEN, Nucleus for Research, Education, Dissemination and Neurosciences Popularization, Department of Neurobiology and Program of Neurosciences, Institute of Biology, Federal Fluminense University, Niterói 24020-141, Brazil; Department of Neurobiology and Program of Neurosciences, Institute of Biology, Federal Fluminense University, Niterói, 24020-141, Brazil.', '6 Department of Neurobiology and Program of Neurosciences, Institute of Biology, Federal Fluminense University, Niterói, 24020-141, Brazil; School of Medicine, Federal Fluminense University, Niterói 24033-900, Brazil.', '7 Department of Neurobiology and Program of Neurosciences, Institute of Biology, Federal Fluminense University, Niterói, 24020-141, Brazil; National Institute of Science and Technology on Neuroimmunomodulation - INCT-NIM, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-360, Brazil.', '8 Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Laboratory of Neurochemical Interactions, Biomedical Institute, Federal Fluminense University, Brazil.', '9 NuPEDEN, Nucleus for Research, Education, Dissemination and Neurosciences Popularization, Department of Neurobiology and Program of Neurosciences, Institute of Biology, Federal Fluminense University, Niterói 24020-141, Brazil; Department of Neurobiology and Program of Neurosciences, Institute of Biology, Federal Fluminense University, Niterói, 24020-141, Brazil; National Institute of Science and Technology on Neuroimmunomodulation - INCT-NIM, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-360, Brazil; Rio de Janeiro Neuroinflammation Research Network, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-360, Brazil.
